       "\"\\nLawrance v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity\\nCommission [2006] FCA 100 (9 February 2006)\\n\\n1 These are two applications for orders of review under the Administrative Decisions\\n(Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (\\\"the AD(JR) Act\\\").\\nThey concern correspondence sent to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity\\nCommission (\\\"the Commission\\\") by the applicant in late 2005.\\nIn a letter dated 26 September 2005, the applicant wrote to the Commission concerning\\nallegations of unlawful discrimination.\\nThe Commission replied in a letter dated 7 October 2005, in which it indicated that it\\nwas not able to assist her.\\nOn 13 October 2005, the applicant again wrote to the Commission.\\nThat letter addressed alleged breaches of human rights.\\nThe applicant wrote to the Commission a third time on 7 November 2005, this time\\nconcerning allegations of sexual harassment.\\nThe Commission did not respond to the second and third letters it received from the\\napplicant.\\n2 It is now accepted in these proceedings in which the Commonwealth Attorney-\\nGeneral has intervened to act as a contradictor, that the Commission either failed to\\nrespond or responded inappropriately to the applicant's correspondence.\\nAccordingly, it is accepted by the respondents and the Attorney-General that in these\\ntwo applications it is appropriate that orders be made.\\nIt was suggested by the second respondent and the Attorney-General that orders with\\nsubstantial operative effect should be made only in matter NSD 1957 of 2005, that is\\norders made setting aside what had been done by the Commission.\\nAs to NSD 2340 of 2005, it was proposed that the application be dismissed.\\nIn my opinion, however, the preferable course is for orders to be made in both matters,\\neven though this may involve duplication, in terms of the ultimate legal effect of such\\norders.\\n3 One point of difference between the applicant and the respondents and the Attorney-\\nGeneral as to what orders should be made concerns whether orders should be made\\nrequiring the President of the Commission (\\\"the President\\\") to exercise certain powers\\nin relation to some of the complaints.\\nThe statutory scheme involves the lodgement of certain complaints, relevantly, unlawful\\ndiscrimination and sexual harassment, and the referral of the complaints to the\\nPresident under s 46PD of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act\\n1986 (Cth) (\\\"the HREOC Act \\\").\\nThereafter the Act requires the President to inquire and attempt to conciliate.\\nThat obligation is found in s 46PF of the HREOC Act .\\nHowever, that general duty is qualified by the power conferred on the President by s\\n46PH to terminate a complaint for one or more of the nominated grounds.\\n4 The applicant has submitted that in addition to any order requiring the Commission\\nto refer some of her complaints to the President under s 46PD of the HREOC Act ,\\n\\n\\n\\nthere should be orders made requiring the President to inquire and attempt to conciliate\\nunder s 46PF and certain other orders concerning attendant powers of the President,\\nincluding holding a conference under s 46PJ.\\n5 In my opinion, it is sufficient that an order be made requiring the Commission to refer\\nthe matter to the President.\\nI am of that view for two reasons.\\nFirstly, although this is a subsidiary issue, the President is not presently a party to these\\nproceedings.\\nThe utility of an order requiring the President to do some act under s 46P and later\\nprovisions, in the absence of the President being a party, is questionable.\\nHowever, that procedural deficiency could, of course, be remedied by the joinder of\\nthe President.\\n6 The more significant reason why I do not propose to make the orders sought by the\\napplicant is that the HREOC Act itself directs the President to do certain things upon\\nthe referral to him or her of a complaint under s 46PD.\\nIt seems unnecessary and probably inappropriate for this Court to make an order\\nrequiring the President to do that which the Act requires the President to do.\\nIn addition, some of the orders sought by the applicant presuppose that the matter will\\nbe dealt with by the President in a particular way.\\nThey presuppose, for example, that the President will not exercise the power under\\ns 46PH.\\nThat power is a discretionary power available to the President and it would be\\ninappropriate to make an order that assumes it will not be exercised.\\n7 Accordingly, I propose to make an order only that the complaints be referred to the\\nPresident.\\nIt will then be a matter for the President to determine what powers are exercised and the\\nmanner in which they are exercised consistent with the statutory scheme which prima\\nfacie requires the President to inquire into and attempt to conciliate the complaint.\\n8 Insofar as the complaint involving an allegation of a breach of human rights is\\nconcerned, it is accepted by the respondents that an appropriate order is that the matter\\nbe remitted to the Commission to be dealt with in accordance with s 20(1)(b).\\nThat paragraph provides that the Commission is required to perform certain functions\\nidentified in s 11(1)(f) , namely to inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent\\nwith or contrary to any human right, and consequential conduct.\\n9 The order proposed by the Attorney-General on his behalf and on behalf of the\\nrespondents is sufficiently prescriptive to enliven the processes flowing from s 20(1) of\\nthe HREOC Act (which, subject to s 20(2), places an obligation on the Commission to\\nperform the functions referred to in s 11(f)).\\n10 Another matter is an application by the applicant that her name be suppressed.\\nAlso, the applicant requested that orders be made in matter NSD 2340 of 2005\\ndirected to the respondents concerning the matters to which the complaints relate and\\nrestraining their conduct.\\n\\n\\n\\n11 Dealing with that second matter, it seems inappropriate to make the orders sought.\\nThe power to do so is found in s 16(1)(d) of the AD(JR) Act which empowers the Court\\nto make an order relevantly directing a party to refrain from doing any act or thing.\\nThat power is enlivened where the Court considers it is necessary to do justice between\\nthe parties.\\nI am not affirmatively satisfied that the orders sought are orders that are necessary to\\ndo justice between the parties.\\n12 Insofar as the alleged conduct of the second respondent is concerned, that is the\\nmatter that is the subject of complaint and it is appropriate that the procedures under\\nthe HREOC Act and related legislation be allowed to operate.\\nAs to the other orders proposed by the applicant are concerned, I am not satisfied they\\nare necessary to do justice between the parties.\\n13 In relation to the proposed order suppressing the name of the applicant, the power\\nto make such an order is found in s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)\\n(\\\"the FCA Act \\\").\\nSuch an order can be made by the Court if it is of the view it is necessary in order to\\nprevent prejudice to the administration of justice.\\nAs counsel for the second respondent and the Attorney-General said, the

bring these applications, as she is entitled to do.\\nIt is true that, in effect, the Commission has accepted that her earlier complaints have\\nnot been dealt with in accordance with the legislative

They concern correspondence sent to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (\\\"the Commission\\\") by the applicant in late 2005. In a letter dated 26 September 2005, the applicant wrote to the Commission concerning allegations of unlawful discrimination. The Commission replied in a letter dated 7 October 2005, in which it indicated that it was not able to assist her. On 13 October 2005, the applicant again wrote to the Commission. That letter addressed alleged breaches of human rights. The applicant wrote to the Commission a third time on 7 November 2005, this time concerning allegations of sexual harassment. The Commission did not respond to the second and third letters it received from the applicant. 2 It is now accepted in these proceedings in which the Commonwealth Attorney- General has intervened to act as a contradictor, that the Commission either failed to respond or responded inappropriately to the applicant's correspondence. Accordingly, it is accepted by the respondents and the Attorney-General that in these two applications it is appropriate that orders be made. It was suggested by the second respondent and the Attorney-General that orders with substantial operative effect should be made only in matter NSD 1957 of 2005, that is orders made setting aside what had been done by the Commission. As to NSD 2340 of 2005, it was proposed that the application be dismissed. In my opinion, however, the preferable course is for orders to be made in both matters, even though this may involve duplication, in terms of the ultimate legal effect of such orders. 3 One point of difference between the applicant and the respondents and the Attorney- General as to what orders should be made concerns whether orders should be made requiring the President of the Commission (\\\"the President\\\") to exercise certain powers in relation to some of the complaints. The statutory scheme involves the lodgement of certain complaints, relevantly, unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment, and the referral of the complaints to the President under s 46PD of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (\\\"the HREOC Act \\\"). Thereafter the Act requires the President to inquire and attempt to conciliate. That obligation is found in s 46PF of the HREOC Act . However, that general duty is qualified by the power conferred on the President by s 46PH to terminate a complaint for one or more of the nominated grounds. 4 The applicant has submitted that in addition to any order requiring the Commission to refer some of her complaints to the President under s 46PD of the HREOC Act ,    there should be orders made requiring the President to inquire and attempt to conciliate under s 46PF and certain other orders concerning attendant powers of the President, including holding a conference under s 46PJ. 5 In my opinion, it is sufficient that an order be made requiring the Commission to refer the matter to the President. I am of that view for two reasons. Firstly, although this is a subsidiary issue, the President is not presently a party to these proceedings. The utility of an order requiring the President to do some act under s 46P and later provisions, in the absence of the President being a party, is questionable. However, that procedural deficiency could, of course, be remedied by the joinder of the President. 6 The more significant reason why I do not propose to make the orders sought by the applicant is that the HREOC Act itself directs the President to do certain things upon the referral to him or her of a complaint under s 46PD. It seems unnecessary and probably inappropriate for this Court to make an order requiring the President to do that which the Act requires the President to do. In addition, some of the orders sought by the applicant presuppose that the matter will be dealt with by the President in a particular way. They presuppose, for example, that the President will not exercise the power under s 46PH. That power is a discretionary power available to the President and it would be inappropriate to make an order that assumes it will not be exercised. 7 Accordingly, I propose to make an order only that the complaints be referred to the President. It will then be a matter for the President to determine what powers are exercised and the manner in which they are exercised consistent with the statutory scheme which prima facie requires the President to inquire into and attempt to conciliate the complaint. 8 Insofar as the complaint involving an allegation of a breach of human rights is concerned, it is accepted by the respondents that an appropriate order is that the matter be remitted to the Commission to be dealt with in accordance with s 20(1)(b). That paragraph provides that the Commission is required to perform certain functions identified in s 11(1)(f) , namely to inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent with or contrary to any human right, and consequential conduct. 9 The order proposed by the Attorney-General on his behalf and on behalf of the respondents is sufficiently prescriptive to enliven the processes flowing from s 20(1) of the HREOC Act (which, subject to s 20(2), places an obligation on the Commission to perform the functions referred to in s 11(f)). 10 Another matter is an application by the applicant that her name be suppressed. Also, the applicant requested that orders be made in matter NSD 2340 of 2005 directed to the respondents concerning the matters to which the complaints relate and restraining their conduct.    11 Dealing with that second matter, it seems inappropriate to make the orders sought. The power to do so is found in s 16(1)(d) of the AD(JR) Act which empowers the Court to make an order relevantly directing a party to refrain from doing any act or thing. That power is enlivened where the Court considers it is necessary to do justice between the parties. I am not affirmatively satisfied that the orders sought are orders that are necessary to do justice between the parties. 12 Insofar as the alleged conduct of the second respondent is concerned, that is the matter that is the subject of complaint and it is appropriate that the procedures under the HREOC Act and related legislation be allowed to operate. As to the other orders proposed by the applicant are concerned, I am not satisfied they are necessary to do justice between the parties. 13 In relation to the proposed order suppressing the name of the applicant, the power to make such an order is found in s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (\\\"the FCA Act \\\"). Such an order can be made by the Court if it is of the view it is necessary in order to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice. As counsel for the second respondent and the Attorney-General said, the ordinary position is that such orders are not made and the C-ourt needs to be affirmatively satisfied that the suppression or non-disclosure order is necessary. 14 The applicant has elected to bring these applications, as she is entitled to do. It is true that, in effect, the Commission has accepted that her earlier complaints have not been dealt with in accordance with the legislative regime. In those circumstances, the applicant, has been required to avail herself of the Court's procedures and processes to vindicate her rights under the HREOC Act to have complaints dealt with in accordance with the legislative scheme. However, in my view, that is not a sufficient reason to make an order under s 50 of the FCA Act . The published reasons of this Court, which will reveal her name, are limited to a broad description of the various complaints she has sought to have the Commission investigate. I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.

One is brought by the first, second and third applicants in the substantive case ('the first notice of motion'), the other by the first and second respondents in the substantive case ('the second notice of motion'). For convenience, I shall refer to the first notice of motion in this case as that brought by 'the applicants', and the second notice of motion as that brought by 'the respondents', and I propose to deal with them in that order. 2 On 15 February 2006 I ordered the parties to make discovery by verified List of Documents and file and serve such List of Documents on or before 4.00 pm on 29 March 2006. 3 The applicants filed and served their List of Documents on 13 April 2006 and provided inspection of the documents contained in the applicants' List of Documents to the respondents on 4, 8 and 9 May 2006. On 11 May the respondents requested the provision of certain documents contained in the applicants' List of Documents and these were provided on 16 May 2006. 4 The respondents filed and served their List of Documents on 29 March 2006 on the applicants on 28 April 2006. On 19 April 2006 the applicants requested the provision of certain documents contained in the respondents' List of Documents and these documents were provided on 28 April 2006. 5 Solicitors for both the applicants and the respondents depose that on 28 June 2006, McCullough Robertson, acting on behalf of the respondents, wrote to Lynch & Co, acting on behalf of the applicants, and noted that they intended to raise with them 'the issue of the inadequacy of the applicants' discovery' (affidavit of Paul Hardman of 20 July 2006 par 4). 6 (Reference to this letter of 28 June 2006 and this specific statement was repeated in par 8 of the affidavit of Mr Paul Lynch filed 27 July 2006. At the hearing of these notices of motion last Friday the respondents objected to certain evidence of the applicants, including par 8 of Mr Lynch's affidavit. This objection is somewhat surprising, given that Mr Hardman deposes to the same facts in his affidavit par 4. ) 7 The immediate history of this matter is set out in (2006) FCA 920. The hearing of the substantive case was scheduled to commence on Monday 17 July 2006 for two weeks. On the application of the applicants I adjourned the hearing of this matter for reasons including that a considerable volume of material was put before the applicants in the days before the trial. 8 The notices of motion represent claims by each party in respect of documents for which they are seeking discovery.    Discovery 9 Order 15 Federal Court Rules deals with discovery. The parties in particular have referred me to O 15 rr 2(3), 3, 6 and 8, and Practice Note 14. 10 Order 15 r 2(3) provides that: Without limiting rule 3 or 7, the documents required to be disclosed are any of the following documents of which the party giving discovery is, after a reasonable search, aware at the time discovery is given: (a) documents on which the party relies; and (b) documents that adversely affect the party's own case; and (c) documents that adversely affect another party's case; and (d) documents that support another party's case. 11 Matters to be taken into account in for the purposes of making a reasonable search as required by r 2(3) are set out in O 15 r 2(5), namely: (a) the nature and complexity of the proceedings; and (b) the number of documents involved; and (c) the ease and cost of retrieving a document; and (d) the significance of any document likely to be found; and (e) any other relevant matter. 12 Order 15 r 3 provides that: (1) The Court may, before or after any party has been required under rule 1 to give discovery, order that discovery under rule 2 by any party shall not be required or shall be limited to such documents or classes of documents, or to such of the matters in question in the proceeding, as may be specified in the order. (2) The Court may make such orders under sub-rule (1) as are necessary to prevent unnecessary discovery. 13 Rule 6 provides that: (1) A list of documents required by or under this Order shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be in accordance with Form 22 and conform to the requirements of this rule. (2) A list of documents shall enumerate the documents which are or have been in the possession, custody or power of the party making the list. (3) A list of documents shall enumerate the documents in a convenient sequence and as shortly as possible, but shall describe each document or, in the case of a group of documents of the same nature, shall describe the group sufficiently to enable the document or group to be identified. (4) ... (5) ... (6) ... (7) ... (8) ... 14 Rule 8 provides for orders for particular discovery and is as follows: Where at any stage of the proceeding, it appears to the Court from evidence or from the nature or circumstances of the case or from any document filed in the proceeding that there are grounds for a belief that some document or class of document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding may be or may have been in the possession, custody or power of a party, the Court may order that party: (a) to file any affidavit stating whether that document or any document of that class is or has been in his possession, custody or power and, if it has been but is not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it; and (b) to serve the affidavit on any other party. 15 Notwithstanding my order of 15 February 2006 it appears that a considerable volume of material was disclosed by the respondents to the applicants in the days leading to trial in July this year. 16 On the other hand, the respondents claim that a significant amount of material remains to be discovered by the applicants.    17 The adjournment of the hearing of this case, because of issues involving relevant documents which both parties claim require disclosure, requires questions of further discovery to be resolved without delay. Without doubt, it is in the interests of the litigants that discovery be concluded, to ensure this matter be progressed to trial in November this calendar year. 18 Both the written and oral submissions of counsel in this hearing focused on two composite documents, both of which were prepared by the solicitors for the respondents for the purposes of the hearing. These composite documents contained comments from each party, and were headed: • Response to page 4 of fax dated 14 July 2006 and further response to fax dated 20 July 2006 . This table of responses refers specifically to some of the documents listed in the schedule attached to the applicants' notice of motion and sought by the applicants, and summarises pre-hearing communications between the legal representatives of the applicants and the respondents as to those documents. • Schedule of applicants' undiscovered documents . This schedule contains a list of documents sought by the respondents, and summarises pre-hearing communications betweens the legal representatives of the applicants and the respondents as to those documents. 19 During the hearing I noted that a considerable volume of material had been filed by the parties by way of affidavit, both in the lead up to and during the hearing itself. I asked the parties to consider whether they had any additional submissions to direct my attention to specific aspects of those affidavits. It was clear however, both from the written and oral submissions, and the responses of counsel, that the key documents for both parties are the two composite documents I note above. The First Notice of Motion 20 The applicants in the first notice of motion sought the following orders: 1. The first and second respondents file an affidavit stating whether any of the documents or classes of documents referred to in the schedule to this application is or has been in their possession, custody or power and, if it has been but is not then in their possession, custody or power when they parted with it, such affidavit to be filed and served within 7 days of the date of this order. 2. The first and second respondents file and serve a Supplementary List of Documents in Form 22 and otherwise in compliance with O 15 r 6 of the Federal Court Rules within 14 days of the date of this order discovering any document annexed to the affidavits of the respondents' witnesses filed in this action which are not already listed in the first and second respondents' List of Documents filed 29 March 2006 and the documents referred to in the affidavit required to be filed by par 1 of this order. 3. The first and second respondents and the solicitors for the first and second respondents file and serve an affidavit within 14 days of the date of this order stating the grounds and reasons why the documents contained in the schedule prepared by the first and second    respondents and tendered to the Court on 17 July 2006 --- (a) were not discovered in the first and second respondents' List of Documents filed 29 March 2006; and/or (b) were not discovered by Supplementary List of Documents between 29 March 2006 and the date of the delivery of the first and second respondents' statements to the applicants; and/or (c) have not yet been discovered. 4. The first and second respondents pay the first, second and third applicants' costs of this motion to be taxed. 21 The Schedule attached to the notice of motion reads as follows : Strahley Paragraph Class of documents referred to in paragraph not discovered in Respondent's List of Documents 11 Agreement for Purchase of Assets dated 24 January 2001 14 Agreement for Purchase of remaining 20 percent held by Vendors 18(g) Reports provided by Davidson and Sims 20 Farm Management Reports 20 Budgets 22 Farm Manager Reports prior to August 2004 23 Budget Summaries 32 Records detailing rejection by juice producers 40 SmartPak and TotalPak software data files 1998-2005 41 E-mails between Strahley and Breed since April or May 2004 in which Strahley had requested Breed to provide historical data as to pack out rates and crop yields for the orchards 41 Diary notes of conversations between Strahley and Breed about SmartPak 41 E-mails between Strahley and Breed in which Breed forwarded Strahley Excel spreadsheet of data from SmartPak system 42 Communication between Strahley and Sandy Wheeler in which Strahley forwarded historical packout data to her 42 Diary notes of conversations between Strahley and Sandy Wheeler in which Wheeler discussed SmartPak and TotalPak 43 Diary notes of telephone conversation with Breed in June and July 2004 in which Breed discussed TotalPak 46 Emails concerning the drafting of budgets between Strahley, Breed and Bailey commencing in March of the relevant year 48 Hancock Board paper evidencing the consideration of various options in relation to the orchards and the view that the orchards were not performing in accordance with their return criteria 49 Corporate policy of Hancock in relation to valuation 52 Communication between Breed and Strahley in which Breed provided Strahley with bin numbers 62 Diary notes of the conversation between Strahley and Douglas in relation to Peter Tracy 63 Diary notes of the conversation between Strahley and Douglas concerning Peter Tracy 66(a) The historical data referred to in this sub- paragraph by Mr Strahley 66(b)(ii) The information received from Mr Sims and diary notes of the discussion with Mr Sims as to lemon prices 66(b)(iii) The daily Fruit Marketing Reports received and read by Strahley 66(b)(iv) The First Budget referred to in this paragraph 67 The communication between Breed and Strahley in which Breed provided Strahley with the Block Summary Data 69(b) Hancock Board minute evidencing the decision to sell the orchards referred to by Strahley 69(e) The Block Summary documents on which it is alleged Mr Tracy made notes 69(m) The computer file off Mr Strahley's laptop which contains the First Budget 69(s) The actual pack out rates for 2004 and the notional budgeted packout rates for the financial year 30 June 2005 referred to by Strahley Diary notes of the conversations referred to between Strahley and Tracy 103 Computer file for Strahley office computer upon which contains clause referred to in paragraph 102 105 Diary note of conversation between    Strahley and Tracy referred to therein Employment Contract - Matthew Burns Notice of Resignation - Matthew Burns to Sunstate Orchards Copies of material provided by Andrew Strahley to Hancock Board from May 2004 concerning historical yields and packout percentages for Bundaberg and Tiaro Orchards Copies of any minutes of the Hancock Board containing resolutions or evidencing discussion of the material provided to it by Mr Strahley from May 2004 concerning historical yields and packout percentages for Bundaberg and Tiaro Orchards 22 I understand the reference to 'Strahley paragraph' in the first column to be a reference to paragraphs in the affidavit of Mr Andrew Strahley sworn and filed 12 July 2006. 23 Prior to the hearing there were communications between the parties as to documents for which the applicants now seek an order for discovery. On 14 July 2006 Lynch & Co on behalf of the applicants faxed a letter to McCullough Robertson on behalf of the respondents, inter alia , asking for further discovery of documents which Lynch & Co had identified as relevant from the affidavit of Mr Andrew Strahley. There was further correspondence between the parties, including facsimile transmissions between the parties on 20 July 2006. 24 A table of responses was prepared headed 'Response to page 4 of fax dated 14 July 2006 & further response to fax dated 20 July 2006', and handed to me in Court. The submissions of the parties, to the extent that they dealt with this notice of motion, referred to this table. 25 I note however that the documents referred to in the Schedule to the notice of motion, and the documents referred to in the table of responses handed to me in Court, are not identical. The Schedule to the notice of motion includes additional documents which, to the extent I can ascertain, have not been previously discussed by the parties. They are: • Agreement for purchase of remaining 20% held by vendors (par 14 Strahley affidavit) • Reports provided by Davidson and Sims (par 18(g) Strahley affidavit) • Records detailing rejection by juice producers (par 32 Strahley affidavit) • Employment contract --- Matthew Burns • Notice of resignation --- Matthew Burns to Sunstate Orchards • Copies of material provided by Andrew Strahley to Hancock Board from May 2004 concerning historical yields and packout percentages for Bundaberg and Tiaro Orchards • Copies of any minutes of the Hancock Board containing resolutions or evidencing discussion of the material provided to it by Mr Strahley from May 2004 concerning historical yields and packout percentages for Bundaberg and Tiaro Orchards. First order sought 26 It is useful to address in turn each document in the Schedule attached to the notice of motion. Agreement for Purchase of Assets dated 24 January 2001 (par 11 Strahley affidavit) 27 The respondents have indicated that this document is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Strahley sworn and filed 12 July 2006. However, as submitted by the applicants, inclusion of a document as an annexure to an affidavit is not, in itself, proper discovery of the document.    While the rules of discovery have been subject to change over time and in different courts, the comments of Lindley LJ in Kennedy v Dodson (1895) 1 Ch 334 at 340 over a century ago continue to apply, namely: 'It is the right, as a general rule, of a plaintiff in equity to exact from the defendant a discovery upon oath as to all matters of fact which, being well pleaded in the bill, are material to the plaintiff's case about to come on for trial, and which the defendant does not by his form of pleading admit. ' 28 Even earlier, Lyndhurst LC in Taylor v Rundell (1841) Cr & Ph 104, 41 ER 429 framed discovery in terms of an obligation which parties to litigation must satisfy: 'If it is in your power to give the discovery, you must give it; if not, you must show that you have done your best to procure the means of giving it. ' (ER 433, cf more recently von Doussa J in Re McGorm; ex parte Co-operative Building Society of SA (1989) 86 ALR 275 at 278 and Tamberlin J in KC v Shiley Inc [1997] 796 FCA (14 August 1997). ) 29 Order 15 of the Federal Court Rules creates a framework for discovery in this court, failure to comply with which can have serious consequences for parties to an action. In my view it is clear that simply annexing a document to an affidavit is not in itself 'discovery' of that document within O 15. 30 The applicants have submitted further that this document is relied on by the respondents as part of their evidence-in-chief in this action. This submission is not disputed by the respondents. 31 Accordingly it appears that this document is discoverable within the terms of O 15 r 2. Agreement for purchase of remaining 20% held by vendors (par 14 Strahley affidavit) 32 No submissions have been made by either the applicants or the respondents in relation to this document. Paragraph 14 of Mr Strahley's affidavit sheds little additional light on the document description, and indeed no document of this description is referred to in that paragraph. My attention has not been directed elsewhere to any other reference to this document. Further, the relevance of the document is not immediately clear. 33 I do not have sufficient evidence before me at this stage to make an order for discovery under O 15. Reports provided by Davidson and Sims (par 18(g) Strahley affidavit) 34 Similar concerns apply in relation to these documents. Indeed, while Mr Strahley in par 18(g) of his affidavit refers to Messrs Davidson and Sims, there is no reference in this paragraph to any reports they may have prepared. My attention has not been directed to any other reference to these documents, and the nature of their contents and the relevance thereof is not immediately clear. 35 I do not have sufficient evidence before me at this stage to make an order for discovery under O 15. Farm Manager Reports (pars 20 and 22 Strahley affidavit) 36 The specific documents sought by the applicants are Farm Manager Reports for the years 2003 and 2004. The years in question were clarified after correspondence between the parties. 37 Although in their table of responses addressed by the parties in Court, the respondents disputed that these documents are relevant, they also submit that the documents have already been discovered by the applicants.    At the hearing, Mr McQuade for the respondents drew my attention to the List of Documents filed by the applicants on 13 April 2006, p 8 item 53, which states 'December 2001-February 2005, Hancock Farm Company --- Farm Management Reports'. The respondents therefore submit that discovery by them of these documents is unnecessary, on the basis that the applicants already have them (O 15 r 2(4)). 38 The applicants however submit that the documents are relevant, and that they should be discovered by the respondents. 39 Order 15 r 2(4) provides: 'However, a document is not required to be disclosed if the party giving discovery reasonably believes that the document is already in the possession, custody or control of the party to whom discovery is given. ' 40 Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicants, their List of Documents speaks for itself. It appears that they already have these records. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, O 15 r 2(4) applies. Budgets and Budget summaries (pars 20 and 23 Strahley affidavit) 41 There does not appear to be any dispute as to the relevance of these documents. The respondents claim however that all relevant documents have been discovered in accordance with O 15. In the table of responses, the respondents invited the applicants to identify any specific budget or budgetary summary they considered should be discovered. 42 The applicants made specific requests, namely that: • the respondents identify by reference to discovery number the Budgets referred to in par 20 of Mr Strahley's affidavit which they assert have been discovered • the respondents identify by reference to discovery number the Budget summaries referred to in par 20 of Mr Strahley's affidavit which they assert have been discovered. 43 The respondents repeated their previous response. 44 In my view the further response of the respondents is unsatisfactory. These documents should be discovered. Records detailing rejection by juice producers (par 32 Strahley affidavit) 45 Paragraph 32 of Mr Strahley's affidavit states 'Waste has been negligible or immaterial'. There is no reference in this paragraph to any records as sought by the applicants. My attention has not been directed to any other reference to such records. 46 I do not have sufficient evidence before me at this stage to make an order for discovery under O 15. SmartPak and TotalPak software data files 1998-2005 (par 40 Strahley affidavit) 47 These documents are also the subject of a discovery application by the respondents. 48 It is common ground that: • the 'SmartPak' and 'TotalPak' records are data files located on a computer • the computer is located in the packing shed which is currently on property controlled by the respondents. 49 However, each party claims that: • they do not have the documents in their possession, custody or power; rather • the other party has the documents in their possession, custody or power.    50 The applicants have submitted that, as the computer is on the property of the respondents, the respondents should return the computer to the applicants. In turn, the respondents have submitted that they would, if requested, allow the applicants access to the packing shed to obtain the records. 51 In light of this apparent consensus, it is somewhat surprising that these records continue to require a ruling by this Court. 52 The parties have not sought an order, nor do I propose to make any order giving rise to any inference, that operates as a final adjudication upon any entitlement, by way of right, in either party to the property in question, in terms of proprietary or possessory title to the relevant computer or its contents. The question arises however as to whether the documents are in the 'possession, custody or power' of either party. 53 The terms 'possession, custody or power' in O 15 represent three alternative states. As summarised in one learned text: 'The term \\\"possession\\\" means the physical or corporeal holding of the document pursuant to a legal right to its possession... (for example, agents and bailees); \\\"custody\\\" means the mere actual physical or corporeal holding of a document, regardless of its right to possession, (for example, servants and employees)...; and \\\"power\\\" means an enforceable right to inspect the document or to obtain possession or control of it from the person who ordinarily has it in fact. ' (SD Simpson, DL Bailey and EK, Evans Discovery and Interrogatories 2 nd edn, Butterworths, Australia, 1990 at 43, see also Halsbury's Laws of England 4 th edn vol 12 Discovery par 39. With respect to 'possession' and 'custody' see also Santow J in Horsley v Phillips Fine Art Auctioneers Pty Ltd (1995) 7 BPR [97557] at 14,371-14,372; Stephen J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [1977] HCA 57 ; (1979) 143 CLR 499 at 504-505; and S Fisher Commercial and Personal Property Law, Butterworths, Australia, 1997 ch 3; and with respect to the meaning of 'power' see also Beaumont J in Australian Independent Newspapers Ltd v John Fairfax Holdings Ltd (Federal Court of Australia, 22 June 1994) par 12 and Lord Diplock in Lonrho Limited v Shell Petroleum (1980) 1 WLR 627 at 635-6. ) 54 However, on the basis of the current arrangements, it appears that the documents are in the possession and custody of the respondents in that: • the respondents have possession, that is the physical or corporeal holding of the documents, on the basis that (it appears) they presently have lawful possession of the computer where the SmartPak and TotalPak files are stored • the respondents have custody of the documents, that is they have the mere actual physical or corporeal holding of the documents, through their physical or corporeal holding of the computer. 55 Although from the submissions of the parties it appears that the applicants may have an enforceable legal right to obtain the documents from the respondents, the applicants do not, in the words of Lord Diplock in Lonrho Limited v Shell Petroleum (1980) 1 WLR 627 at 635-636, have 'power' over the documents. They do not have the enforceable legal right to obtain the documents from the respondents without the need to obtain the consent of anyone else .    The submissions of both parties indicate that the applicants would need to obtain the consent of the respondents to access the computer and therefore obtain the documents. Even if the respondents are likely to comply voluntarily with a request of the applicants to access their property, and in turn the computer and the documents, it does not mean that the documents are currently 'in the power of' the applicants (cf comments of Lord Diplock in Lonrho at 636H). 56 As the respondents have offered to allow the applicants access to the computer containing the records, in my view it is appropriate in relation to these documents that, once the respondents allow the applicants access to the computer and its contents, the applicants discover the records sought by the respondents. Accordingly, at this stage, I make no order for discovery of these documents by the respondents. Emails (par 41 Strahley affidavit) 57 The respondents have stated that they have already discovered these documents. 58 In my view no order for discovery should be made. Diary notes of telephone conversations (pars 41, 42, 43, 62, 63, 98, 105 Strahley affidavit) 59 The respondents have stated that they do not have any such documents in their possession, custody or power. 60 In my view no order for discovery should be made. Communication between Strahley and Wheeler (par 42 Strahley affidavit) 61 The respondents have indicated they have already discovered a document which satisfies this description, and the applicants did not press this claim in correspondence with the respondents. 62 In my view no order for discovery should be made. Emails concerning drafting of budgets (par 46 Strahley affidavit) 63 The respondents have indicated they have already discovered documents which satisfy this description, and it appears that the applicants did not press this claim in correspondence with the respondents. 64 In my view no order for discovery should be made. Hancock Board paper and Board minute evidencing decision to sell the orchards (pars 48 and 69(b) Strahley affidavit) 65 Paragraph 48 in the affidavit of Mr Strahley is as follows: 'On or about May 2004, Hancock decided to consider various options as to the future of the Property. By this stage, the Board of Hancock had reached the view that the Property was not performing in accordance with its return criteria. ' 66 In par 69(b) Mr Strahley deposes: 'During the course of the meeting, Mr Tracy asked me why Sunstate Orchards was selling the property. I said to him that the Board had made a decision to sell the Property based on past performance and it was no longer within the desired portfolio for Hancock as the company was moving away from citrus...' 67 In the table of responses, the respondents initially stated that the document was not relevant, but subsequently provided a copy of a document titled 'Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd Position Report April/May 2004'.    The respondents also stated that they had no further such documents in their possession, custody or power. 68 The applicants submit that the document titled 'Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd Position Report April/May 2004' is a report to the Board, not a Board paper. 69 The applicants in the table of responses claimed that the Hancock Board paper evidencing the decision to sell the orchards, together with all material upon which that decision was made, is relevant to proof of the reasonableness of the respondents' predictions as to the orchards' performance made to the applicants some months later. In their written submissions, the applicants claimed that documents of this kind at Board level fall within O 15. 70 In my view, Board papers, including minutes of meeting, as sought by the applicants fall within the criteria in O 15 rule 2(3) and are discoverable. Corporate policy of Hancock in relation to valuation (par 49 of Strahley affidavit) 71 It appears that the respondents have endeavoured to provide this document, however the applicants claimed in the table of responses that parts of the document are illegible. 72 The respondents stated that they provided a copy of the document by facsimile on 20 July 2006 and by letter on 26 July 2006. 73 At this stage I do not consider an order for discovery to be necessary. Communication between Breed and Strahley in relation to bin numbers (par 52 Strahley affidavit) 74 The respondents have indicated they have already discovered documents which satisfy this description, and have been unable to locate other documents. It appears that the applicants did not press this claim in correspondence with the respondents. 75 In my view no order for discovery should be made. Historical data (par 66(a) Strahley affidavit) 76 The respondents indicated in the table of responses that they have already discovered this document in their List of Documents. 77 In my view no order for discovery should be made. Information received from Mr Sims and diary notes (par 66(b)(ii) Strahley affidavit) 78 The respondents have stated that they do not have any such documents in their possession, custody or power. 79 In my view no order for discovery should be made. Daily Fruit Marketing Reports (par 66(b)(iii) Strahley affidavit) 80 The respondents indicated in the table of responses that they have already discovered this document in their List of Documents. 81 In my view no order for discovery should be made. The First Budget (par 66(b)(iv) Strahley affidavit) 82 The respondents have indicated they have already discovered a document which satisfies this description in the affidavit of Mr Strahley. There does not appear to have been proper discovery of this document within O 15. 83 For reasons I outlined earlier in this judgment as to the need for proper discovery of documents by litigants, this document should be discovered by the respondents.    Communication between Breed and Strahley (par 67 Strahley affidavit) 84 The respondents have stated that they do not have any such document and it appears that the applicants did not press this claim in correspondence with the respondents. 85 In my view no order for discovery should be made. The Block Summary documents (par 69(e) Strahley affidavit) 86 The respondents have stated that they do not have any such documents in their possession, custody or power. They believe this document is in the possession of the second applicant. I note that the applicants did not press this claim in correspondence with the respondents. 87 In my view no order for discovery should be made. Computer files off Mr Strahley's laptop (pars 69(m) and 103 Strahley affidavit) 88 I note the respondents' statement in the table of responses that a disk containing these computer files would be delivered before 5.00 pm on 27 July 2006. 89 At this stage, I do not propose to make any order for discovery in relation to this document. Actual pack out rates (par 69(s) Strahley affidavit) 90 The respondents do not dispute the relevance of the document. They claim however that it is an interrogatory rather than a request for discovery. 91 The respondents indicated in the table of responses that a hard copy of this file is in Mr Strahley's affidavit. The applicants press for a computerised version to determine the provenance of the document. 92 On the basis that a hard copy of the document has already been provided by the respondents, their claim that the request of the applicants is an interrogatory is not sustainable. 93 The document in electronic form should be discovered by the respondents. Employment Contract --- Matthew Burns; Notice of Resignation --- Matthew Burns; Copies of material provided by Andrew Strahley to Hancock Board; Copies of any minutes of the Hancock Board from May 2004 94 While these documents may be discoverable, no submissions have been made by either the applicants or the respondents in relation to these documents. My attention has not been directed to any reference to these documents in the affidavit of Mr Strahley or elsewhere. 95 I do not have sufficient evidence before me at this stage to make an order for discovery under O 15. Second Order sought 96 A large volume of material has been produced by the respondents since their List of Documents was filed on 29 March 2006. In my view it is clear that proper discovery has not been made by the respondents in this matter. Indeed, following the production of a significant quantity of material in the days leading to trial, an unidentified proportion of which had not been previously discovered, the trial was adjourned, with resultant considerable inconvenience to all parties and this Court.    97 It is appropriate that the applicants be in a position where they can properly prosecute their claim. Fairness requires that the respondents produce documentation in accordance with the Federal Court Rules , which includes a Supplementary List of Documents in Form 22 in the terms sought. Accordingly, I am prepared to make the order in substantially the terms sought by the applicants. I note that this order will also address the document referred to as 'the First Budget' in the Schedule to the applicants' notice of motion, to which I have already referred. Third Order sought 98 I note the order sought by the applicants in this case in relation to the delay of the respondents in disclosing relevant documents, their failure to discover the documents in their List of Documents filed 29 March 2006 and/or by Supplementary List of Documents, and the fact that a large number of documents were disclosed immediately before trial, thus necessitating an adjournment of the trial. 99 As I have already indicated, I have concerns about the approach taken by the respondents towards discovery in this case. However, in my view it is important that the parties concentrate on preparation for trial. Little can be achieved at this point from requiring the respondents to depose on oath why they did not discover these documents earlier, and I agree with Mr McQuade that, at this point, it would not produce an effective result for the course of the trial. 100 This is an issue which may however be relevant to costs in due course. In my view, it is best dealt with then. Fourth order sought 101 I propose to make an order that costs be reserved. The Second Notice of Motion 102 The respondents in the second notice of motion sought the following orders pursuant to O 15 Federal Court Rules : 1. The applicants within 7 days provide discovery by list of the documents described in the attached schedule and inspection of those documents be provided within 14 days. 2. In the alternative, the applicants file an affidavit stating whether the document or any of the documents of that class is or has been in their possession, custody or power, when it was parted with and what has become of it. 3. The affidavit referred to in par 2 above be served on the first and second respondents within 14 days. 4. The time for service of the Notice of motion be abridged until a time no later than 4.00 pm, 20 July 2006. 5. Any other Orders that this Honourable Court deems appropriate. 6. Costs.    103 In my view it is appropriate to deal with the subject of the first three orders sought by the respondents together, before turning to the remaining orders in their notice of motion. Mr McQuade on behalf of the respondents handed me a modified version of the Schedule during the hearing ('Schedule of Applicants' Undiscovered Documents'), indicating --- by bold font --- a number of documents for which the respondents no longer press. The documents for which the respondents no longer press are, using the numbering in the schedule as follows: • Item 11. Income Tax Returns for both first and second applicants for year ended 30 June 2006 • Item 23. Trend line data constructed by second applicant • Item 24. Email from David Breed to second applicant dated 28 February 2005 • Item 29. Weekly reports for performance, picking, packing, dispatch and pricing, payments received and debtors listing for period from 21 March 2005 to 23 June 2005 • documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents from documents discovered by the National Australia Bank Limited pursuant to Order dated 28 June 2006 and identified by the following numbers: 32, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45. 104 The balance of the Schedule is useful because it groups documents for which the respondents seek discovery. Confidentiality Agreement between the First Respondent and the Second Applicant (Item 1) 105 This document is identified in the affidavit of the second respondent sworn 12 July 2006 par 83. The second respondent deposes: 'On Friday 10 December 2004, a meeting was held at Hancock's meeting room at 167 Eagle Street, Brisbane. At the commencement of the meeting Mr Tracy, in my presence, signed a copy of the Confidentiality Agreement that I had previously sent to Mr Douglas on 6 December 2004. I also signed the agreement. It was signed in duplicate. I have undertaken an extensive search for the signed agreement and it cannot be located. ' 106 It is also identified in the affidavit of Mr Peter Douglas sworn 7 July 2006 par 39 where he deposes: 'On 6 December 2004 at about 2.33 pm, I sent Mr Tracy an email attaching a confidentiality agreement. ' 107 During the hearing the applicants submitted: • the document is the document of the respondents • it is not relevant to any contested allegation in the proceedings • they do not have an executed copy of the document. 108 The applicants further acknowledged that the confidentiality agreement may become relevant to the question of reliance because the document may contain an acknowledgment as to reliance. 109 In the circumstances, it is discoverable by the applicants.    Financial Documents held by Administrator of the Third Applicant (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12) 110 The third applicant is currently subject to a deed of company arrangement in accordance with Pt 5.3A Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). As a general rule the administrator has control of the company's business, property and affairs (s 437A(1)(a)) , the powers of other officers of the company are suspended (s 437C) , and the administrator is entitled to all books and records of the company (s 438C). If the company becomes subject to a deed of company arrangement, the affairs of the company are conducted according to the deed (s 444G). 111 In relation to the financial documents of the third applicant, the applicants state that these documents were seized by the administrator on his appointment on 23 June 2005. Accordingly, the applicants submit that the documents are not in their possession, but are in the possession of the administrator, and they cannot discover them. 112 The respondents submitted that a number of the applicants' responses to requests concerning the documents simply state that the documents are not in their possession. The respondents further submit that if the applicants do not have the documents in their custody or power they should say so. The respondents also submit that if documents were in the applicants' possession, custody or power and no longer are, the applicants need to say so in the list of documents. 113 I do not understand the respondents to be submitting that all relevant financial records of the third applicant are not in the possession of the administrator. In other words, I understand that the respondents are not claiming that the applicants have financial records, other than those in the possession of the administrator. 114 However the respondents also submit that, in performing a function of the company under administration, the administrator is taken to be acting as the company's agent. Accordingly, notwithstanding that the records have been seized by the administrator, they do not cease to be records of the company. The respondents therefore submit that those documents are discoverable by the third applicant and should be included in the list of documents. 115 There is no question that the administrator is the agent of the company to which he or she is appointed: s 437B. However, as made clear by s 437A(1) , administrators have very extensive powers over all aspects of the company's business, property and affairs. Indeed as the High Court noted in Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 172 ALR 28 at 30, Div 3 of Pt 5.3A Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) provides that the administrator of a company under administration is to assume control of the company's affairs. On the basis that the administrator had possession of the documents, the relationship of administrator and company as contemplated by Pt 5.3A Corporations Act does not permit the company other than with the consent of the administrator to have 'power'    over documents retained by the administrator: s 438C (cf Lord Diplock's comments in Lonrho at 636H discussed earlier in this judgment). 116 Notwithstanding a submission by the respondents that 'Mr Tracy is responsible for the day to day management of the company', I note that the financial records were produced to the Court by the administrator by subpoena on 21 July 2006. From this event, it is clear that the applicants do not have possession, custody or power over the records, other than as determined by the administrator in the exercise of his powers. In circumstances where a company is under administration, an order for non-party discovery or subpoena is the appropriate order to require the production of documents in the possession of the administrator (cf Beach J in Hore-Lacy v David Syme and Co unreported Supreme Court of Victoria, 5 September 1996, BC9604308 p 4). 117 Order 15 r 15 provides: 'The Court shall not make an order under this Order for the filing or service of any list of documents or affidavit or other document or for the production of any document unless satisfied that the order is necessary at the time when the order is made. ' 118 In the circumstances the court would be imposing an artificial tier of disclosure to order the third applicant to disclose the financial records. 119 It follows that the answer of the applicants in relation to this request of the respondents, namely that they cannot make discovery of these documents, is the correct one. Spray Records (Items 19 and 20) 120 Two issues arise in relation to these items, namely: • the dispute as to who has possession of these records • the issue as to the documents 'leading to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case'. 121 The applicants and the respondents each claim that they are not in possession of these records. 122 The respondents however submit that the applicants plead that certain matters were revealed by the spray records which were not disclosed to the applicants; that the records have not been discovered; and that on settlement of the sale of the property the records remained at the property. The respondents submit further that the applicants must have the documents as they have relied on information from them to plead the allegations in pars 17A(c) and (d) of the Statement of Claim. 123 In summary, the response of the applicants (other than that they do not have the documents in their possession) is that these are documents generated by the respondents. 124 In my view, the submissions of the respondents have merit. The applicants have relied on these records --- if they were ever in their possession, custody or power but are no longer, it is appropriate for the applicants to state when this occurred and why. 125 However, as noted by the applicants, the respondents have also submitted that the records subsequent to settlement 'will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents case or damage the applicants' case'.    The applicants submit that this submission, which is replicated throughout the Schedule, relates to a test of disclosure obsolete since 1999. 126 In my view it is not necessary to consider this issue in the context of these records, for reasons I have already explained. However, this issue is more relevant in respect of other documents for which discovery is sought, and I shall deal with it later in this judgment. TotalPak records (Items 2, 17, 22 and 30) 127 As submitted by the respondents, these documents are central to the applicants' case, and are the subject of pleadings in par 19 of the applicants' Statement of Claim. The respondents submit that, for this reason, they should be discovered by the applicants. 128 I note that item 22, which is grouped with the other TotalPak records, is addressed somewhat differently in the Schedule. I also note that the applicants state that they currently do not have the documents in their possession, and that they are conducting searches at the orchards in an effort to locate any such documents. 129 In relation to the documents comprised in item 22, which do not appear to have the same access issues as the documents in items 2, 17 and 30, it is appropriate that the documents be discovered. 130 I have already discussed the SmartPak and TotalPak records, which appear to be in items 2 and 17, in this judgment. 131 The respondents have also submitted that the records subsequent to settlement 'will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case'. In light of the view I take of these documents it is unnecessary to consider this issue. 132 The packout documents in item 30 are also on the computer. These should be dealt with in the same way as the SmartPak and TotalPak records. The second applicant's 100 day plan (Item 14) 133 The applicants submit that they have already discovered this document and that it consists of two separate documents: • the 'Sunstate Orchards Acquisition Implementation Plan', and • the 'Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd kick off meeting Maryborough'. 134 The respondents however submit that the document described by the applicants as the '100 day plan' is not those documents, for two reasons: 1. A witness, Mr James Palfreeman, deposed in his affidavit sworn 6 July 2006 that he was specifically shown a document described as a 100 day plan by the second applicant, and that the document consisted of a number of items. I note in particular paragraphs 14 and 15 of that affidavit. 2. The documents which the applicants have identified as the 100 day plan refer in turn to: • in the case of the Sunstate Orchards Acquisition Implementation Plan --- 'develop and implement 100 day plan' • in the case of Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd kick off meeting Maryborough --- there are two references in the Action Items to (in relation to    the Advisory Board visit) \\\"100 day plan\\\" and (in relation to the Management Meeting Process and content) 'Implementation of 100 day plan'. 135 The clear inference which may be drawn, in particular from the second reason (given that those documents actually refer to a document described as the '100 day plan'), is that there is a separate document which is the '100 day plan'. 136 Accordingly, it is necessary for the applicants to discover this document. 137 The respondents have also submitted that the records subsequent to settlement 'will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case'. The applicants submit that this submission of the respondents, which is replicated throughout the Schedule, relates to a test of disclosure obsolete since 1999. In my view however it is not necessary to consider this issue in the context of this document. Leaving aside the issue of exact identification, there does not appear to be any contest by the applicants that the '100 day plan' should be discovered. 138 Before turning to consider other documents in the Schedule which were not the subject of written submissions, it is appropriate to deal with the issue of discovery sought on the grounds that the document 'will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case'. 'Train of Inquiry' (Items 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 50, 55, 56, 58) 139 I have already noted this issue in relation to items 14, 19, 20, 22 and 30. In relation to these items however, it was unnecessary to consider this issue on the basis that: • in relation to item 14, the issue was not whether the document should be discovered, but whether it had been discovered • in relation to items 19, 20, 22 and 30 in my view it was clear that the documents fell within O 15 r 2(3). 140 The other documents listed however, namely those referred to in items 13, 15, 21, 27, 28, 50, 55, 56 and 58, also refer to this test. 141 During the hearing this issue was the subject of some contention. Counsel for both parties have since filed supplementary submissions. 142 In essence, the submissions of the applicants are as follows: 1. Order 15 r 2(3) sets out the criteria by which the obligation to disclose might be tested. 2. Those criteria do not include documents leading to a train of inquiry. That was the test before the rules were amended in 1999. 3. Order 15 r 2 should be interpreted according to its terms; and the 'train of inquiry' test (as articulated in the leading case of The Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Company (1882) 11 QBD 55 per Brett LJ at 63, note also Menzies J in Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341 at 345) has no place in that context. 4. General discovery is that which occurs under O 15 r 2.    5. Order 15 r 8 entitles a court to make an order wider than that apprehended under O 15 r 2, however only where an application is made under O 15 r 8. 6. In terms of the Federal Court Rules and Practice Note 14, the order made by the Court on 15 February 2006 was an order apprehended under O 15 r 2(3). 143 The submissions of the respondents may be summarised as: 1. The order of 15 February 2006 was 'The applicants and the respondents make discovery by verified List of Documents and file and serve such List of documents on or before 4.00 pm on 29 March 2006'. 2. The order did not limit discovery to the categories of documents in O 15 r 2, O 15 r 2(3) or otherwise. 3. Order 15 r 2 continues to authorise orders for general discovery, and although the court would not ordinarily make an order for general discovery it may consider it appropriate to do so, in which case the traditional obligations to discovery any document relating to a matter in question in the proceeding continues to apply. 4. Pursuant to O 15 r 8 the court may make orders requiring discovery of a document or class of documents 'relating to a matter in question in the proceeding' that may be or may have been in the possession, custody or power of a party. 5. An order of the court that the parties give discovery, without any further limitation , is a general order or direction for discovery. To limit the ambit of discovery the order, by its terms, should limit the extent of the discovery to be made by a party. 6. As there was no limitation appearing in the orders/directions the direction was for general discovery and the train of inquiry test applies. 7. Alternatively, the court may order a document or class of documents be discovered by affidavit in terms of O 15 r 8. 144 The current version of O 15 r 2 was introduced into the Rules by SR 295 of 1999 Schedule 1, and became effective 3 December 1999. On the same day Practice Note 14 was issued by the Chief Justice. This Practice Note states, inter alia , that: • the general position is that the Court will not order general discovery as a matter of course • the Court will mould any order for discovery to suit the facts of a particular case • in determining whether to order discovery the Court will have regard to the issues in the case and the order in which they are likely to be resolved, the resources and circumstances of the parties, the likely cost of the discovery and its likely benefit • to prevent orders for discovery requiring production of more documents than are necessary for the fair conduct of the case,    orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by O 15 r 2(3). 145 There seems no doubt that, as a result of the 1999 amendments to O 15 r 2, the criteria in O 15 r 2(3) superseded the 'train of inquiry' test as the usual requirements for discovery. As pointed out by Branson J in Lubizol Corp Inc v Imperial Chemical Industries plc [2000] FCA 1464 (par 9) '...unless the Court should order to the contrary, documents the relevance of which is only that they may fairly lead to a train of inquiry which may directly or indirectly enable one party to advance its case or change that of its opponent are not required to be discovered. ' (note also Finn J in South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd [2000] FCA 519 at par 10, The Hon Justice JW von Doussa 'Discovery in the Federal Court' Law Society of South Australia and the Federal Litigation Section Seminar, 14 March 2000; Spyer v Cuddles 'N' Mum (Franchise) Pty Ltd (No 3) (2002) FCA 1563 pars 4-8; Aveling v UBS Australia Capital Markets Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 415 at par 10). 146 The history to the amendment to O 15 r 2(3) was explained by Lindgren J in Spyer v Cuddles 'N' Mum (Franchise) Pty Ltd (No 3) (2002) FCA 1563. His Honour in that case also observed that the broader test of 'relating to any matter in question in the proceeding', which derives from the Peruvian Guano case, continues to be used in the context of O 15 r 8 (par 6 of Spyer ), and that in this respect there is a disconformity between the tests of discoverability as between O 15 r 2(3) and r 8 (par 7 of Spyer ). 147 In Aveling v UBS Australia Capital Markets Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 415 , Lindgren J considered the principles which should guide the parties in identifying categories of documents. His Honour observed that they were the same principles which guide the Court when ordering discovery, and continued: 'It may be appropriate for parties to describe categories in terms which do not expressly incorporate the language of O 15 r 2(3), but that subrule should nonetheless govern the formulation of the categories. Alternatively, of course, the categories may be defined so as to incorporate expressly the terms of the subrule. Whatever approach is taken, it is important to understand that when, as happened in the present case, the Court orders discovery by categories to be notified by one party to another, the Court does not intend that the notifying party be at liberty to widen the discovery obligation beyond the four classes of documents referred to in O 15 r 2(3). ' (par 11) 148 More recently, Lindgren J had cause to consider the operation of O 15 r 2(3) in Australian Competition & Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd (2005) FCA 366. Significantly, after reciting r 2(3), his Honour said at par 23: 'In the rare case in which the Court grants leave to a party to give a notice requiring general discovery, that subrule operates, rather than, as formerly, the Peruvian Guano test, to identify the discoverable documents. The Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Federal Court Amendments Rules 1999 (No 6) (SR 1999 No 295) stated of the new subrule 2(3) that '[t]he aim of    the rule is to limit the documents that must be discovered to those which are directly relevant to the proceedings. ' 149 The history of the law in this area, and more recent cases, indicates that 'general discovery' means an unqualified or unlimited order for discovery, possibly in one of the following forms: • as noted by Beaumont J in Reading Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Birch Carroll & Coyle Ltd [2002] FCAFC 109 at 70, quoting Butterworths Practice & Procedure of the Federal Court at [40.760] --- 'general discovery as traditionally understood'. This refers to discovery of any document which may fairly lead to a train of inquiry, as per the Peruvian Guano test, and is consistent with the submissions of the respondent; or • as submitted by the applicants, 'general discovery' as is now contemplated by O 15 r 2(3) (The court may make an order for particular discovery in broader terms under O 15 r 8). 150 In my view, in the absence of qualifications or limitations to an order for discovery, the correct interpretation is that the discovery ordered by the Federal Court pursuant to O 15 is that contemplated by O 15 r 2(3), as submitted by the applicants. Clearly this will not be the case if the Court makes an order pursuant to O 15 r 8, which, as pointed out by Lindgren J in Spyer v Cuddles 'N' Mum (Franchise) Pty Ltd (No 3) (2002) FCA 1563 , seems to countenance a continuation of the broader test of discoverability. 151 This interpretation is consistent with: • Order 15 r 5, which is titled ' Order for General Discovery ', and provides: 'The Court may, at any stage of the proceeding, order any party to give discovery in accordance with rule 2. ' • the amendments to O 15 r 2 in 1999, the aim of which, according to the Explanatory Statement Statutory Rules 1999 No 295, was 'to limit the documents that must be discovered to those which are directly relevant to the proceedings' (note also Advanced Medical Institute per Lindgren J at par 23) • Practice Note 14, which states that orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by O 15 r 2(3) • Order 15 r 8 which continues to use the language of Peruvian Guano but only in the context of particular discovery and • the authority of cases to which I have already referred, in particular Spyer , Aveling and Advanced Medical Institute . 152 The respondents have referred to comments of Beaumont J in Reading Entertainment at par 70 concerning the court ordering general discovery following the 1999 amendments, however in my view his Honour's observations were referable to extraordinary circumstances where the courts may order discovery in accordance with the Peruvian Guano test. Although his Honour did not give the example, an order pursuant to O 15 r 8 would be an instance of such a circumstance. 153 The consent order made on 15 February 2006 was in my view an unqualified order for general discovery, as contemplated by O 15 r 5, and requiring discovery of documents as contemplated by O 15 r 2, in particular subrule 2(3). Accordingly, the 'train of inquiry' test as posed by the respondents in this case is not applicable.    154 It is appropriate to consider the remaining documents in the Schedule where this test is sought to be applied, in that light. Other documents in the Schedule (Items 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 33, 34, 37, 39, 41, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58) 155 Other documents as listed in the Schedule were not the subject of written submissions by counsel. The Schedule does however provide a summary of the communications between the applicants and the respondents on the issue of discovery of these documents. Item 10 Rain data records 156 In seeking discovery of these documents, which are identified as rain data records of the first or second applicant in respect of the Bundaberg and Tairo Orchards, the respondents claim they are relevant to loss and damage, and cite par 21 of the amended Statement of Claim and par 30 of the Defence. 157 In support of this contention the respondents rely on statements of Sheppard and Pincus JJ in Netaf Pty Ltd v Bikane Pty Ltd (1990) 92 ALR 490 at 494. This case also involved an application under s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the sale of a business. The majority of the Full Court said: 'We reiterate that, where a purchase has been induced by misleading conduct, it is not enough, in order to recover losses subsequent to the purchase, to prove that but for the misleading conduct or as a partial consequence of it, the agreement to purchase would not have been made; that is so in every successful application of that kind. It is not the law that in every such case the party held to have been engaged in misleading conduct (who may have acted quite innocently) becomes the insurer of the other's success and prima facie liable to indemnify him against the consequences of the purchase. As the trial judge said in the present case: \\\"To recover a loss sustained in the business, the applicant must show more than that it was sustained in the conduct of that business; for to show only that is to establish what is perfectly consistent with the loss having arisen from his own misguided management decisions, or even total neglect. \\\"' 158 I agree with this reasoning. 159 The applicants state that: • records up to 22 March 2005 are in the possession of the respondents already and are not required to be discovered by the applicants • the applicants do not have records after 22 March 2005, but they may be with the Administrator. 160 Unfortunately the respondents have not specifically indicated how these documents satisfy the criteria under by O 15 r 2(3). To the extent that the applicants are required to prove their case --- as explained by the Full Court in Netaf --- the rain data records appear to be documents which fall within r 2(3). The response of the applicants does not suggest a dispute that the documents are discoverable. 161 However, the applicants have stated that these documents up to 22 March 2005 are already in the possession of the respondents. This is not denied by the respondents.    In my view, O 15 r 2(4) applies in this case. It is difficult to know what further could be achieved by requiring the applicants to discover the documents. 162 Unless there is some further reason why the applicants should provide discovery of those documents, it is unnecessary to make an order requiring them to do so (note recent similar comments of Bennett J in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition & Consumer Commission [2006] FCA 737 at par 31). 163 In relation to the documents after 22 March 2005, on the basis that the documents are in the possession, custody or power of the administrator, in my view the applicants are not required to discover them for the reasons I have already explained in relation to documents held by the administrator. Item 13 Westpac and ANZ documents and correspondence 164 I note that the respondents have stated that this documentation will lead to a train of inquiry which would advance their case or damage the applicants' case. I have already held that this test is not applicable in this case. 165 The respondents state that the documents are relevant to reliance, and point to par 18 of the amended Statement of Claim and par 17 of the Defence. 166 In my view the documents sought fall within O 15 r 2(3) and should be discovered. Item 15 Copies of all cash flow 167 I note that the respondents have stated that this documentation will lead to a train of inquiry which would advance their case or damage the applicants' case. I have already held that this test is not applicable in this case. 168 However the applicants in their letter of 5 July 2006 offered to provide the documents to the respondent if the respondents identified any relevant contested matter. The respondents have identified par 18 of the amended Statement of Claim and par 17 of the Defence. I do not understand that the applicants are disputing the discoverability of the documents in relation to the contested allegations identified by the respondents. 169 Accordingly, these documents should be discovered. Item 16 Creditors invoices for first applicant 170 The respondents have identified par 21 of the amended Statement of Claim and par 30 of the Defence as contested allegations forming the basis of an order for discovery. The applicants have not disputed the discoverability of the documents in relation to the contested allegations identified by the respondents. 171 Accordingly, I order the documents to be discovered. Item 18 Email from David Breed to the second applicant 172 There appears some dispute over whether this document has already been discovered. The applicants submit that it has been discovered, however the respondents submit that the document cannot be identified in the applicants' List of Documents filed 13 April 2006, and they are unable to identify whether this document has been discovered. 173 Otherwise, there does not appear to be any dispute as to whether this document should be discovered.    174 In the circumstances, the appropriate order is that the applicants discover the document. Item 21 Management reports for the Orchards and Packing shed 175 In relation to management reports up to 22 March 2005 it appears that the documents are the documents of the respondents and are in their possession. This is not denied by the respondents. Accordingly, in my view it is unnecessary to order discovery of those documents (O 14 r 2(4)). 176 In relation to the management reports between 22 March 2005 and 23 June 2005, the respondents claimed they would lead to a train of inquiry which would advance their case or damage the applicants' case. I have already held that this test is inappropriate in this case. 177 However, the respondents in relation to documents between 22 March 2005 and 23 June 2005 also claim that the documents are relevant to loss or damage claimed by the second and third applicants as to causation and measure of loss. The respondents rely on the Netaf case. In my view these documents fall within the scope of O 15 r 2(3) and should be discovered by the applicants. Item 25 Third applicant's orchard management plans 178 There does not appear to be any dispute that this document, if it exists, should be discovered. The applicants claim however that they do not possess the document. On the basis that, as submitted by the respondents, documents of that class are referred to in other documents discovered by the applicants in the circumstances, the appropriate order is that the applicants advise the respondents whether the document is in their custody or power, and if it is, the applicants should discover it. Items 26, 27 and 28 Cash flows, correspondence and emails 179 As submitted by the respondents, the applicants do not suggest that these documents are not discoverable. On 5 July 2006 the applicants indicated that they were searching their records and would revert to the respondents shortly. As at the hearing date of this matter, it appears that they had not been discovered. 180 The appropriate order is that, if the applicants have the documents in their possession, custody or power, they should discover them. Item 31 Email of 12 January 2005 181 Although the respondents do not identify this document in the schedule as a document for which discovery is no longer pressed, the fact that the applicants appear to have provided a copy of this document indicates that an order for discovery is not necessary (O 15 r 15). Remaining documents in the Schedule Items 33, 34, 37, 39, 41, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 182 The remaining documents in the Schedule for which discovery is sought fall into six categories: 1. Documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents from documents discovered by the National Australia Bank Limited pursuant to Order dated 28 June 2006. This list comprises items 33,34, 37, 41 and 46.    2. Documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents from documents discovered by Herron Todd White pursuant to Order dated 28 June 2006. This list comprises items 47, 48, and 49. 3. Documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents from the email from the second applicant to David Breed dated 7 February 2005, part of discovered document no 149 of the first and second respondents' List of Documents dated 29 March 2006. This list comprises items 50, 51, 52 and 53. 4. Further documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents. This list comprises items 54, 55 and 56. 5. Documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents from the email from the second applicant to David Breed dated 11 April 2005 (part of email from David Breed to Peter Nichols, copied to the second applicant, on 12 April 2005). This list comprises item 57. 6. Documents or categories of documents identified by the first and second respondents from the applicants' discovered document titled 'Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd Kick Off Meeting'. This list comprises item 58. 183 It is not clear to me whether the respondents have these documents already as a result of previous discovery, although the applicants suggested at the hearing that that was the case. 184 Mr Perry for the applicants submitted that it is a matter of concern that, at least in respect of some of the documents it appears that the respondents may have had them since 29 March 2006. Alternatively, if the respondents do not have the documents, it seems that in relation to such documents the respondents have had the opportunity since 29 March 2006 to seek discovery. 185 It does not appear that these items have been the subject of previous correspondence between the parties. As a consequence of this, there are few grounds submitted by the respondents as the basis of discovery, and no responses from the applicants in relation to discovery of these documents. To the extent that I can interpret the Schedule, the only grounds submitted as a basis for discovery of these documents are: • in relation to items 33, 34, 37, 41 and 46: they are relevant to allegations in issue and reliance.    They will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case • there are no grounds asserted in relation to items 47, 48 and 49 • in relation to items 50, 51, 52, 53: these classes of documents are relevant to allegations in issue as to reliance and loss or damage. They will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case; also see Netaf Pty Ltd v Bikane Pty Ltd (1990) 92 ALR 490 at 494 • in relation to items 54 and 55: these classes of documents are relevant to allegations in issue as to reliance. They will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case • in relation to item 56: these classes of documents are relevant to allegations in issue as to reliance. They will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case. Also see Netaf Pty Ltd v Bikane Pty Ltd (1990) 92 ALR 490 at 494 • there are no grounds asserted in relation to item 57 • in relation to item 58: these classes of documents are relevant to allegations in issue as to loss or damage. They will also lead to a train of inquiry which would advance the respondents' case or damage the applicants' case. Also see Netaf Pty Ltd v Bikane Pty Ltd (1990) 92 ALR 490 at 494. 186 Other than in relation to the '100 day plan' referred to in item 58, and in relation to which an order will be made, it is not possible to identify whose documents these documents are. I also note there is some duplication, for example '2005 business plan' in items 53 and 56, 'SHE plan' in items 53 and 58, 'marketing plan' in items 53, 56 and 58, and 'communications plan' in items 53 and 56. 187 Although the respondents have referred to the Netaf case in relation to a number of the items, the relevance of the principle is not substantiated in relation to these items. Further, the 'train of inquiry' test is applied in relation to all documents with the exception of items 47, 48, 49 and 57. 188 On the basis of the evidence before me I am not satisfied that an order for discovery is necessary in relation to any of these documents. Fourth Order sought 189 I order that the time for service of this Notice of motion be abridged until a time no later than 4.00 pm 20 July 2006. 190 I propose to make an order that costs be reserved. Conclusion 191 Practice Note 14 indicates that orders for discovery should be moulded to suit the facts of a particular case. The history of this case indicates that supplementary discovery is clearly necessary, particularly, it appears, by the respondents. It is important however, in the interests of the parties and the conduct of this matter, to allow the parties a realistic time frame in which to comply with their obligations under the Federal Court Rules . 192 It is also in my view important to ensure that the parties, so far as possible, are on an even footing in relation to available evidence, their obligations to discover relevant    material, and to paraphrase Tamberlin J in KC v Shiley Inc , are not surprised by new material unexpectedly appearing. ORDERS As to the First Notice of Motion the Court orders that: 1. The first and second respondents file an affidavit stating whether any of following documents or classes of documents referred to in the schedule to this application is or has been in their possession, custody or power and, if it has been but is no longer in their possession, custody or power when they parted with it, such affidavit to be filed and served within 7 days of the date of this order: • Agreement for Purchase of Assets dated 24 January 2001 • Budgets • Budget Summaries • Hancock Board paper evidencing the consideration of various options in relation to the orchards and the view that the orchards were not performing in accordance with their return criteria • Hancock Board minute evidencing the decision to sell the orchards referred to by Strahley • The actual pack out rates for 2004 and the notional budgeted packout rates for the financial year 30 June 2005 referred to by Strahley. 2.

He came from a marketing background but wanted to promote the use of natural gas in the transport sector. From the outset Mr Brand was the managing director of the company and provided his services in that capacity under successive agreements made between Energy and his private company, Martech International Pty Ltd (Martech). 2 Energy grew to become a substantial public company with interests in gas and power projects in Australia and overseas, including Indonesia and India. In 1999 however, it experienced financial difficulties. Its share price dropped and its principal financier the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) advised that it was not prepared to refinance or renegotiate a \\$115 million facility which it had provided. 3 Energy explored various options including asset sales. In the end a new investor came to its rescue in the form of Energy World International Ltd (EWI), whose principal was Mr Stuart Elliott. As an aspect of the restructuring that followed EWI's involvement, Mr Elliott replaced Mr Brand as managing director and Mr Brand became an executive director of the company. Ultimately, he resigned from the company in November 2001. 4 The parting of the ways between Mr Brand and Energy has given rise to the present litigation. Mr Brand's company, Martech, has made a variety of claims against Energy. One of the claims is for a shortfall of fees following its unilateral, but temporary, reduction in the fees paid under the service contract for the period from 1 March 2000 to 30 September 2000. That shortfall is claimed at \\$71,663.65. Martech also claims a substantial Termination Payment in excess of \\$800,000 which it says is due under the contract by reason of the change in Mr Brand's status from managing director to executive director and the change in his duties. Claims for damages for misleading or deceptive conduct are also made. 5 For the reasons that follow, I consider that Martech is entitled to the shortfall in agreed fees for the period 1 March 2000 to 30 September 2000. I do not consider that there is any entitlement to a Termination Payment. Nor do I consider that any of the other causes of action brought by Martech have been made out. 6 Energy and its subsidiary, Australian Energy Equity Ltd (AEE) cross-claim against Martech and Mr Brand arising out of a payment made in respect of a power station development in India.    This development is known as the Vypeen Combined Cycle Power Project (the Vypeen Project). It is said that, in 1999, Mr Brand authorised a milestone payment in connection with the development of the Vypeen Project when the contractual condition of a Sale and Purchase Agreement, under which that payment had to be made, had not been satisfied. The relevant condition was that approvals had been obtained from the Indian Government for the importation of condensate fuel for use as an interim fuel in the proposed power station. A clearance given by one Ministry was later contradicted by another. It is alleged that Mr Brand failed in his duty to Energy and AEE by authorising the payment without taking reasonable care or exercising due diligence to ensure that it was due. 7 In my opinion because of Mr Brand's reasonable reliance on the judgment of a senior officer of Energy and the circumstances surrounding the payment, I am satisfied that he did not fail in his duty and the cross-claim against him and Martech in that respect should be dismissed. Energy World and Martech in 1999 - Background 8 Energy was incorporated in March 1985 and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in December 1989. Fletcher Maurice Brand has been a shareholder of Energy since its incorporation and its Managing Director from that time until 29 September 2000. His services as Managing Director were provided under consecutive agreements entered into between his private company, Martech and Energy. One such an agreement was made on or about 28 May 1999 (the Agreement). It provided that Mr Brand was to act as Energy's managing director for the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2003. Martech was to be paid a fee of \\$500,000 per annum, reviewable on 1 July in each year of its term and to be increased by at least the annual percentage increase in the CPI on each such occasion. Under Energy's Constitution, adopted in 1998, Mr Brand as managing director was not required to retire on a rotational basis as were other directors of Energy. The services of most of Energy's senior staff were provided under consultancy agreements made with companies controlled by those staff members. In 1998 all of these agreements contained provision for termination payments calculated according to the length of service and payable if termination occurred other than by resignation or for cause. 9 In October 1997 Energy negotiated a two year facility with the CBA for a maximum advance of about \\$115 million. Monies advanced under the facility were to be repaid or rolled over for a ten year period in January 2000. However towards the end of 1999 the CBA advised Energy that it was not prepared to refinance or renegotiate the facility.    It wanted the money repaid. At that time Energy's share price had declined. It had reached a peak of about \\$1.60 in the middle of 1998 and had declined to between 30 and 35 cents in the second half of 1999. The shares continued to decline through 2000. Energy Board meeting - 3 February 2000 10 At a meeting of the Energy Board on 3 February 2000 Mr Brand reported that the CBA facility had been extended to 29 February 2000. The CBA had refused to commit to a longer term. It would not agree to any extension until after the settlement of the sale of one of the company's projects known as Basin Bridge. This stance created a significant liquidity problem for Energy. The Board of Directors canvassed its options including refinancing, asset sales and reduction of overheads. It also considered seeking an injection of capital from a third party. 11 Present at the Board meeting was Stuart Elliott, the managing director of an unrelated company, EWI. He was a non-executive director of Energy. Also present, by invitation, was Mr Ian Jordan an Executive Director of EWI. He had been appointed to the Board of Energy on 29 November 1999 as an alternate director to Mr Elliott. 12 There was discussion at the meeting about a possible capital injection by EWI, which had previously been under consideration. EWI had commissioned a due diligence report by Poynton Corporation which it had received in draft on 21 January 2000. Mr Elliott said that EWI had confidence in Energy's asset base and that the company had a lot of potential. His group was prepared to put in \\$10 to \\$15 million through a funding arrangement and to underwrite a rights issue. However, he wanted to see a change in Energy's management. It suffered from a negative market perception which he estimated was worth at least 10 cents per share. He expected EWI would be a bigger shareholder in the future. It had already invested substantially in Energy and was concerned about management performance, particularly because of the size of write-offs made in September 1999 for the year ended 30 June 1999. Mr Elliott also queried the level of overheads at the corporate office and was told by Mr Brand that staff levels had dropped by 20 over the preceding 12 months. 13 The minutes of the meeting record that the EWI proposal was discussed in the absence of Messrs Ellliott and Jordan. They rejoined the meeting after that discussion and were informed of the status of the CBA facility.    Mr Elliott said that EWI could make \\$5 million available with \\$10 million as a standby facility. However in return he would need 'some management autonomy'. The Chairman of the Board, Ronald Punch, said it was important that Mr Elliott complete his proposal so that it would be clear to the Board what he was preparing to do and how he saw his future management role. Mr Elliott said that initially he would expect to put in some financial and/or technical personnel. He expected the Board to decide on the role of EWI appointees and the persons to whom they would report. The Board resolved that Mr Punch, Mr Brand, Mr Hayes, the executive director finance, and Mr Elliott meet with the CBA to discuss the debt reduction program. Mr Elliott also asked that his representative from Poynton Corporate attend. 14 Mr Brand said, in evidence, that he told the Board that there had been a large reduction in staff over the previous months and that he had asked Energy's consultants to take temporary reductions in their fees pending the sale of the Basin Bridge project and other assets. They had agreed and the reductions would take effect from 1 March 2000. Mr Brand said he also told the Board that he would reduce his fees temporarily from \\$500,000 per annum to \\$300,000 per annum. Mr Bill Hornaday, who was chief operating officer, had agreed to reduce his fee to \\$200,000. The Chairman Mr Punch, said in effect that the proposed reductions were appreciated. Mr Brand was not cross-examined on that evidence. 15 Mr Brand's evidence was that the arrangements made with Energy's consultants, other than Mr Hornaday, contemplated that their arrears of fees would be paid up when assets were sold. These arrangements covered Messrs Bridgewood, Trigalvcanin and Lindsay. The arrangement he made with Mr Hornaday was similar to his own, namely that the reduction would be temporary and arrears would be paid in options and bonuses. 16 Mr Punch said in his evidence-in-chief that he did not recall Mr Brand making a statement about his fees at the Board meeting. He said it was unlikely that he personally would have thanked him for the reduction in his fees although why that would be so is not apparent. There is no record of Mr Brand's statement in the minutes of the meeting. Mr Punch accepted in cross-examination that he had no memory of what was said at the meeting other than what appeared in its minutes. He said: 'I have no direct recollection of it. It may well have been stated, but I have no recollection of it. ' However, in a letter of 12 March 2000 to Mr Elliott, referred to later in these reasons, Mr Punch acknowledged that Mr Brand had already effected a reduction in his drawings to \\$300,000 per annum from between February 2000 and 30 June 2001.    17 Mr Elliott and Mr Jordan both denied that Mr Brand had made, in their presence, the statements he claimed to have made at the meeting. In cross-examination Mr Elliott agreed that he was aware at the time that Mr Brand and other staff members had consultancy agreements with Energy. Neither he nor Mr Jordan was cross-examined on their evidence that Mr Brand had not informed the Board in their presence of temporary salary reductions. Given the importance accorded, in the statement of claim, to the meeting of 3 February 2000, this is surprising. On the other hand, it was not in dispute that Messrs Elliott and Jordan were absent for part of the meeting while EWI's proposal was discussed. 18 In Martech's statement of claim it is alleged that the board of Energy orally requested Martech (for which read Brand) in or about January 2000 that it forebear from claiming the entirety of the fee to which it was entitled under the Agreement of May 1999. It is then alleged that at the meeting of Energy's Board on 3 February 2000, Mr Brand proposed that Martech would forebear for the time being from claiming the entirety of the fee, would only claim \\$300,000 per annum, and that Energy would compensate Martech for the loss of part of the fee in a manner which would be agreed between them. It is further contended in the statement of claim, that at that meeting the members of Energy's Board orally represented to Martech that Energy was grateful for Martech's forbearance and that Energy would provide compensation in a manner which it would negotiate and agree with Martech. 19 Reference to the minutes of the Board meeting held on 3 February 2000 indicates that meetings of the Board had been held on 4 and 20 January 2000. Neither of those minutes was in evidence. There was no reference in the minutes of the meeting held on 3 February 2000 to the proposal which it is alleged that Mr Brand made at that meeting. Nor was there any reference to the members of the Board responding to any such proposal. However it is not in dispute that from 1 March 2000 to 29 September 2000 Martech was paid at the reduced rate of \\$300,000 per annum. 20 In my opinion, Mr Brand probably told the Board of the reduction in his fees and that of other consultants at the February meeting. It was a prudent and politic response to the parlous financial circumstances of the company. His evidence and Mr Punch's letter of 12 March 2000 support that finding. I am satisfied also that he said his fees were being reduced temporarily. That would have been consistent with a hope that the financial difficulties would be resolved. That does not imply, and the evidence does not support a finding, that Mr Brand proposed, or that the Board agreed, that he would be compensated for the shortfall in due course. Had such an agreement been reached at the meeting in February 2000 it would in all probability have been recorded or at least referred to in the minutes.    It was not. I do not, in so finding, exclude the possibility that Mr Brand hoped or expected that the reduction in his remuneration could be compensated under some agreement which could be negotiated when the company's financial situation had stabilised. Energy Board meeting --- 12 March 2000 21 The EWI proposal was advanced at a meeting of the Board held on 12 March 2000. Mr Punch advised that he had signed an exclusivity agreement between Energy and EWI up to 15 March 2000 as EWI was incurring third party costs in preparation of proposals to the CBA. He had forwarded a letter to the CBA with a copy of the EWI proposal for the provision of a sub-debt of \\$15 million. He had informed the CBA that while some procedural and statutory matters were being addressed, the principle of the proposed funding arrangements offered by EWI had been endorsed by the Energy Board. The Board ratified the letter to the CBA. This may be taken as an acceptance in principle by the Board of the EWI proposal. 22 It also emerged at the meeting of 12 March that, in the course of carrying out due diligence inquiries for EWI, Poynton Partners had reported that cl 3.2 in Mr Brand's Agreement of 28 May 1999 was in breach of cl 10.18 of the ASX Listing Rules. Clause 3.2 provided, in effect, that Martech or Energy could terminate the Agreement in the event that one party or a group of associated parties acquired 25% or more of the issued capital of the company and so altered the composition of the Board that the majority of directors would be nominated or appointed by that controlling party. Mr Elliott had received the Poynton Partners' report and passed it on to Messrs Punch and Brand. Deed of Variation of Martech Agreement --- 13 March 2000 23 The day following the Board meeting of 12 March Martech and Energy executed a Deed of Variation of the Agreement of 28 May 1999. The Deed of Variation amended the Agreement with effect from 1 July 1999 by deletion of cl 3.2 and the consequential deletion of a reference to that clause in cl 8.6. The deed was prepared by solicitors then acting for Mr Brand. There was no reference in the deed to any change in remuneration arrangements. Proposals for reorganisation of Energy and officer remuneration --- 16 March 2000- July 2000 24 On 16 March 2000 Mr Brand wrote to Mr Elliott reconfirming Energy's commitment to proceeding with the proposal which had been discussed over the preceding fortnight. He said: 'Please be assured that all Directors are comfortable and have committed to the process of a restructure so that the confidence and credibility of EEC can be restored. We are appreciative of your efforts to assist in the process and I thank you for your support. ' The letter concluded: 'I will also provide separately the reductions in costs that have taken place following my commitment to you in early February to do so.    I understand that you are comfortable with the reductions for Bill and I as working Directors as explained this afternoon. ' There was no reference to any subsequent 'catch-up' compensation. 25 In a letter sent to Mr Elliott on 17 March 2000, Mr Punch wrote about the need for reorganisation and restructuring of the Board and the management of Energy. He said that this was recognised and acknowledged by directors as an integral part of the new way forward to restore confidence and credibility for Energy. The letter went on: 'Accordingly, this letter is to inform you of the commitment of all Directors in the context of assisting with and supporting the EWI proposal, with the exception of Dr Suparno, to resign from their respective Board positions at the appropriate time. ' He was prepared to stand aside from his position as Chairman and to discuss a timetable for doing so. He referred to the need for discussions with Mr Bill Hornaday regarding his on-going role. He noted that Mr Hornaday had agreed to take a reduction in his drawings from \\$300,000 to \\$200,000 per annum which was put into effect during February 2000 and would continue until 30 June 2001. 26 In relation to Mr Brand, Mr Punch wrote: 'While clearly understanding the requirement for Maurice's position to be re-defined to ensure the expedient implementation of the EWI proposal, the Board believes that he has a positive role in assisting with its implementation. Maurice has suggested the position of Chief Executive Officer (with or without a Board seat), but has no difficulties with any other appropriate title. ' He said that it would be appropriate for Mr Brand to continue coordinating various activities of the company and to report to him weekly so that change would be implemented smoothly. He proposed that Mr Brand continue to manage the West Kimberly LNG and Power Project which was at a critical stage in government processes. Mr Punch wrote: 'You should also be aware that Maurice has already triggered a reduction in his drawings from \\$500,000 to \\$300,000 per annum in February until 30 June 2001. An amendment to his Contract has been instigated. If these arrangements are unacceptable then Maurice has advised that he has no problem in discussing a commercial settlement to have his contract terminated at the appropriate time. ' There was no reference to any foreshadowed adjustment to compensate for the reduction in Mr Brand's drawings. 27 In his written statement Mr Elliott said that he understood from Mr Punch's letter that Mr Brand had agreed to reduce his salary. Neither Mr Punch nor Mr Brand, while engaged by Energy, ever told him verbally or otherwise that the reduction in salary was not permanent or that there would be any arrears due by reason of the reduction. Mr Brand was not cross-examined on this question.    As I have earlier indicated, I am satisfied that Mr Brand did say that the reduction was temporary. I am not satisfied that he made any statement in February or March about claiming back arrears of his fees. 28 On 23 March 2000 Mr Brand sent a memorandum to Mr Mark Lindsay, who was then the company secretary for Energy. The memorandum was headed 'Cash Cost Reductions'. It referred to changes in directors' annual fees and then continued: 'Please note the new annual rates for the following people, effective 1 March 2000. Maurice Brand \\$300,000 Bill Hornaday \\$200,000 Paul Bridgwood \\$150,000 Mark Lindsay \\$120,000 Garry Triglavcanin \\$120,000' Mr Hayes' rate was to remain unchanged pending his departure at Easter time. In his witness statement Mr Brand said that the memorandum referred to cash payment reductions which he had agreed with Energy's consultants, including, Mr Hornaday, Mr Bridgwood and Mr Lindsay. The purpose of the memorandum was to provide Mr Lindsay with information for the preparation of weekly and monthly cash flows. 29 Mr Lindsay's evidence was that he provided his services to Energy through his private company, Bracton Pty Ltd (Bracton). Because of Energy's cash flow problems he was asked by Mr Brand in February 2000 to temporarily forbear from charging the full fees which Bracton would otherwise be entitled to under its consultancy agreement. Mr Brand told him in effect that Energy was proposing to undertake a capital raising. When that was completed he expected that sufficient funds would be available to make good the arrears in the consultancy fees. Mr Lindsay agreed to the forbearance on this basis. He recalled the fee reduction being raised by Mr Brand at at least one directors' meeting at which he was present. He was not cross-examined on his statement and I accept its accuracy. 30 On 4 April 2000 Mr Punch again wrote to Mr Elliott raising topics which he thought should be discussed relevant to the content of an Explanatory Memorandum for the shareholders' meeting necessary to approve the proposed restructure. He asked Mr Elliott to let him have his thoughts on changes to the Board, which he would like to have approved by the shareholders. He referred to changes to Energy's management structure which had been generally canvassed in various discussions and would also have to be outlined in the Memorandum. He said: 'In this regard Maurice will draw up a revised staff schedule and management structure including job descriptions which can then be discussed at the earliest suitable opportunity. ' Consistent with those changes and the putting in place of the new way forward for Energy would be the implementation of a revised Option Incentive Plan for Directors and senior management.    Mr Elliott recalled, in his evidence-in-chief, receiving the letter. He understood at the time that Energy was taking steps to restructure its management and to reduce costs including consultants' fees. 31 Energy submitted in closing that Mr Brand, fully understanding the company's financial difficulties, unilaterally proposed the reduction of his own fee without any qualification or limitation. Martech rendered monthly invoices for its services. Invoices for the period July 1999 to November 2001 were tendered through Mr Jordan. None made any provision for deferment of payment of any amount. All claimed payments at the reduced rates applicable, according to Mr Brand's case, in that period. Mr Jordan, who became an executive director of Energy in September 2000 said that Mr Brand never told him or otherwise indicated to him that he was merely forbearing to claim his full fee entitlement rather than taking a reduction in the fee payable to him. 32 By early July 2000 the sale of the Basin Bridge project and other assets had not occurred. Mr Brand spoke to Mr Punch shortly before 10 July 2000. He told Mr Punch, in effect, that as the sale of Basin Bridge and other assets was not proceeding he would be prepared to waive Martech's outstanding fees (the arrears of payments since March 2000) on the basis of a new structure. He told Mr Punch that he proposed, in general terms, the payment of arrears in the form of options and/or bonuses which would reduce demands on Energy's cash flow. On the other hand it would ensure that Martech continued to receive the agreed return for his services to ensure that he was not disadvantaged. He said in his evidence that the proposal he made was never negotiated and never proceeded any further. He told Mr Punch, in effect, that he was prepared to continue with the reduction in his cash payments until 30 June 2001. Mr Brand's evidence to this effect was neither challenged in cross-examination nor contradicted by other evidence. Rather Energy's position in closing argument was that what Mr Brand did was not by way of temporary forbearance. The reduction in fees, it was submitted, was necessary because of the dire financial situation of Energy which Mr Brand understood intimately. 33 Mr Brand also said that in June or July 2000 he spoke with the consultants who had temporarily waived part of their fees. He asked them to continue to do so. He said that as Energy had entered into a convertible note facility with EWI, which was to be put to shareholders at the AGM due to be held in late September or early October 2000, he expected that arrears would be paid once the funds from the facility were available.    He said that he asked the consultants to continue to forego part of their fees until the facility was in place when they would be paid. They agreed to do so. 34 On 10 July 2000 Mr Brand sent to Mr Punch a memorandum on the subject of directors, management structure and contracts. The memorandum contained 'information and suggestions' for discussions between Mr Punch and EWI. Mr Brand contemplated in the memorandum the probability that he would no longer be Managing Director following the EWI injection. He said: 'If I am no longer Managing Director but remain as a Director, then my appointment will also need to be submitted to the AGM and Suparno's delayed until the 2001 AGM. ' Under the heading 'Executive Directors' he wrote: '2.1 FM Brand My current contract is to 30 June 2003 with an annual fee of \\$500,000 (adjusted annually for CPI effective 1 July 1999); and can be terminated or not renewed by EEC under a pay out provision of, currently, 21 months as at 30 June 2000 after 24 months as at 30 June 2003. In view of the Company's financial position, I agreed in February 2000 that from 1 March 2000, to decrease the amount per day to equivalent to \\$300,000 per annum. ( sic ) As a result, the drawings for 1999/2000 will be \\$479,000 (1998/99 \\$500,000) due to no leave being taken. For 2000/2001 it will be \\$327,500, which includes a carry over of one month as at 30 June 2000. I have previously conveyed to the Board this arrangement to 30 June 2001. No document has been executed by EEC to reflect this position. I was prepared to \\\"waiver\\\" the difference for the period to 30 June 2001 on the basis of a new structure. ' 35 The memorandum foreshadowed that Stewart Elliott and Ian Jordan would both be acting in Energy's management. In a proposed structure which he attached to the memorandum Mr Brand said that because Messrs. Elliott and Jordan would be actively participating in other companies he had adopted for himself a dual role in relation to the company's operation in Australia and what he called 'Corporate' on the basis that he would have a reduced workload in 'the Corporate arena'. He said: 'This revised structure should be reflected in an amended contract for me for the existing contract period to 2003. ' He also foreshadowed that following EWI approval of the structure, amended or new arrangements would need to be negotiated for all personnel. He suggested a base package plus cash bonuses such as a success fee for new projects or for achieving operating results ahead of budget. 36 Mr Brand explained that the purpose of the memorandum was to brief Mr Punch who was travelling to Sydney to meet with Mr Elliott to discuss, among other things, the issues raised in the memorandum.    Mr Punch agreed that he had a meeting with Mr Elliott in Sydney sometime later in July 2000 and discussed the management structure for Energy. However, he did not recall whether he gave Mr Elliott a copy of the memorandum. Mr Punch was asked whether the matters contained in the memorandum were reflective of matters he had discussed with Mr Brand up until that time. His answers to these questions were not particularly responsive. He did say that he was not a party to discussions between Mr Brand and consultants engaged by Energy. 37 Mr Elliott said in his evidence-in-chief that he did not recall having seen the memorandum of 10 July 2000. He said he might or might not have seen it. He did think, however, that there had been discussion with Mr Punch about the agreement by certain of Energy's consultants to take temporary reductions in their remuneration and that they '... expected to catch up their remuneration' when 'the convertible note to be provided by [EWI] was in place'. 38 Mr Brand sent a memorandum to Messrs. Elliott and Jordan on 27 July 2000 asking to discuss the management structure and reporting arrangements with them. He attached a proposed Organisational Structure diagram. He received no response to that memorandum. Brand replaced as Managing Director --- 29 September 2000 39 It was Mr Brand's evidence that in about mid-September 2000 he met with Messrs. Elliott and Jordan in Sydney. In the course of that meeting Mr Elliott told him that he wanted him to cease as Managing Director of Energy for 12 months to negotiate the repayment of the CBA facility. He also told Mr Brand that, in effect, he would be appointed an Executive Director with responsibilities to be determined from time to time. Mr Brand said that he told Mr Elliott that he would cease as managing director on a basis to be agreed. Mr Brand observed that by September 2000, Mr Elliott's company, EWI, controlled Energy in the sense that it could ultimately remove directors by a shareholders' resolution. Mr Elliott therefore controlled the composition of the Board and he had no real alternative but to accept what Mr Elliott said about his future. Mr Elliott, in his evidence-in-chief, flatly denied having had such a conversation with Mr Brand. Mr Jordan denied that Mr Elliott had told Mr Brand, in his presence, that he wanted Mr Brand to cease to be managing director for 12 months. .  40 The Sydney meeting was referred to by Mr Brand in a draft agenda for a Board meeting of 29 September 2000 which he prepared and sent to Mr Elliott on 28 September 2000.    In that draft agenda, which appeared in part to take the form of draft minutes, he included a proposed resolution in the following terms: '2.3 Board Appointments . Following discussions with EWI and pursuant to their proposal outlined under the Convertible Note, Stewart Elliott is to be appointed Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer and the current Managing Director is to be retained as an Executive Director. Based on discussions with Mr Elliott, in Sydney, he has outlined a proposed organisational structure and a paper will be prepared by FM Brand and submitted to Mr Elliott for consideration by 6 October 2000. Accordingly, it would be appropriate for the formal resolution as follows: 2.3.1 Mr SWG Elliott be appointed Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer with effect from 1 October 2000 and that the EEC Chairman negotiates a remuneration arrangement and refer it to the EEC Board for approval; 2.3.2 that the Chairman of EEC negotiates a revised consultancy arrangement with the existing Managing Director, Mr FM Brand, with effect from 1 October 2000, representing his position as an Executive Director and refer it to the EEC Board for approval;' The balance of the resolution dealt with the negotiation of revised arrangements with Mr Hornaday and the appointments of Mr Jordan and Mr Gordon Trayling as Executive Directors. 41 Mr Elliott was cross examined about this part of the draft agenda. He was asked whether he told Mr Brand in Sydney at the meeting referred to in item 2.3 that he wanted him to cease to be managing director. He initially described the change as part of 'voluntary moves' by the Chairman and Directors of Energy. He had no ambition to become managing director of Energy but the CBA had requested it. He denied, however, that he told Mr Brand that he would act as managing director in order to deal with the CBA. It was Mr Brand and his fellow directors who offered to install him as managing director. 42 Notwithstanding the preceding testimony Mr Elliott eventually agreed in cross- examination that he had told Mr Brand in Sydney that the CBA had asked him to become managing director and that if they were to have any chance of saving the company they would have to accede to the CBA's request. I accept therefore that, as Mr Brand said in his evidence, Mr Elliott effectively required him to relinquish his office as managing director and become an executive director instead. Mr Elliott, in so doing, acted in his own capacity. His conduct was not to be attributed to Energy. His effective power came from EWI's status as a major shareholder. I find, moreover, that Mr Brand did not expressly assert any legal entitlement, on behalf of Martech, under which he could continue in that office. He agreed to what Mr Elliott proposed because the financial circumstances of the company, the attitude of its major creditor and Mr Elliott's control of a major shareholder, left him no practical alternative.    43 Mr Elliott was asked in cross examination whether he was aware, by reference to item 2.3.2 of the agenda, that Mr Brand expected there to be a new consultancy agreement to reflect his change of status from managing director to executive director and the change in his remuneration. Mr Elliott said he would have read the agenda but had no recollection of thinking that Mr Brand required a new consultancy agreement. 44 At the meeting of the Board held on 29 September 2000 discussion about Board appointments took place. Messrs. Elliott and Jordan retired during that discussion. The minutes record that Mr Punch noted that EWI had had the carriage of discussions with the CBA. Mr Brand observed that conditions precedent of proposed convertible notes included changes in management. He had discussed the proposed changes with Mr Elliott and it was a requirement that he step aside on a basis to be agreed. 45 Mr Elliott was appointed Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company at a meeting of the Board held on 29 September 2000. (X 7) Mr Jordan was appointed as an Executive Director. It was also resolved that Mr Brand be appointed as an Executive Director. 46 Mr Punch reported that he had discussed the issue of an incentive scheme options plan with Mr Elliott and that the company should establish such a scheme at its next meeting. 47 Mr Brand said in his evidence-in-chief that up until 29 September 2000 he had, as managing director, full responsibility for all of Energy's operations in Australia and overseas and its administration, financial and accounting functions. Mr Lindsay, as Company Secretary and Financial Controller, reported to him as did Maurice Hayes. Mr Brand also had overall responsibility for Energy's Australian field operations at Barcoadine, Alice Springs, Eromanga and Gilmore. Richard Rutherford had managerial responsibility for the Australian operations and reported to Mr Brand through Mr Brand's fellow director, Bill Hornaday. Mr Hornaday had direct responsibility for the company's Indonesian operations and reported to Mr Brand on those. Energy's Indian operations were under a country manager, Mr Selvendra. He reported to Paul Bridgwood, who in turn reported to Mr Brand. Mr Brand's proposed reorganisation and redefinition of roles --- 7 and 31 October 2000 48 On 7 October 2000 Mr Brand sent a further memorandum to Messrs Elliott and Jordan stating, inter alia, that they needed to tidy up the letters/arrangements/consents for their appointments and for his own position. On the same day he sent them a memorandum setting out the proposed organisational structure and cost review.    His memorandum began: 'Further to our ongoing discussions and request to reduce expenditure and to propose a new organisational structure, the following information is submitted. Mark has assisted in this process and analysed the last two-year costs to assist in the evaluation. ' He suggested that he was in a position to provide assistance to Richard Rutherford, who was giving management support for the Australian operations. He proposed that Mr Rutherford report to him under the new organisational structure. He reminded Mr Elliott that following his approval of Mr Hornaday's basic arrangement it was essential that his current contract be amended which would reduce Energy's outstanding liabilities in the event of termination. He noted that the team allocated to the West Kimberley LNG and Power Projects included himself. Towards the end of the memorandum he said: 'Regarding my position, I would propose a further reduction from equivalent to \\$300,000 to \\$240,000 effective to 1 October 2000 with a waiver of any arrears. I would like to participate in the Option Scheme and receive a bonus on Financial Close of the West Kimberley Project. It is important that my contract be amended so that potential liability to EEC is eliminated. ' The latter sentence appears to have been intended to refer to potential liability on the part of Energy to Martech. 49 Mr Brand said that the terms of his engagement as an executive director of Energy were never expressly agreed between Energy and Martech or himself. From 29 September 2000 he ceased to discharge the duties of managing director and ceased to perform any of the duties set out in the schedule to the agreement of May 1999. Martech rendered monthly invoices for his consultancy fees as an executive director and these were paid ) . Mr Elliott, in his evidence-in-chief, said that there was no discussion of an agreement between Martech and Energy in his presence. 50 Mr Elliott agreed that he had received Mr Brand's memorandum of 7 October but assumed that the matters set out in it would be implemented by Mr Brand. The organisational chart attached to the memorandum was broadly consistent with his understanding of Mr Brand's role following his own appointment as managing director. The chart did not include Mr Jordan who, in effect, acted as Mr Elliott's assistant at all times. 51 Mr Elliott said that he remained based in Hong Kong after 29 September 2000. Mr Brand ran the Perth office and, according to Mr Elliott, 'was responsible for the West Kimberley project as well as the Australian operations of [Energy]'. The West Kimberley project involved a tender for the construction and operation of four power plants at Broome, Derby, Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.    52 In cross-examination on the memorandum of 7 October, Mr Elliott seemed curiously reluctant to accept the obvious proposition that it embodied proposals directed to him. Eventually he agreed that it did contain a proposal, inter alia, for a reduction in Mr Brand's fees, participation in an option scheme and a bonus if the West Kimberley project reached a successful financial closure. He also said that he was not aware of whether he did or did not respond to the memorandum. No options were ever allotted to Mr Brand. He did say that he had offered Mr Brand a bonus if the West Kimberley project reached financial closure, but could not recall when. No such offer was put in writing. 53 I am satisfied that Mr Elliott did not respond to Mr Brand's proposals of 7 October 2000 and offered him neither participation in an option scheme nor, in any formal way, a bonus payable in respect of the West Kimberley project. I do not exclude the possibility that a bonus was raised in discussion but am satisfied that it never reached any sort of resolution. In any event, because of the fate of the West Kimberley Project, no bonus would have become payable. 54 Mr Brand sent a further memorandum to Mr Elliott on 31 October 2000 concerning the organisational structure of Energy, a cost review and a budget. He began by noting that he had been unable to discuss his memorandum of 7 October 2000 and attachments with Mr Elliott during the week of 9 October. He advised that nevertheless he had been implementing cash reductions as set out in the memorandum and documents. He listed these and included the following item: 'Reduced M Brand's drawings (as per 7 October memo) by a further \\$5,000 per month plus tax equals \\$5,300.00. ' In item 16 of his memorandum he said: 'During December 2000, it is recommended that, subject to Shareholder approval of the Employee Option Plan on 29 November 2000, that revised arrangements be negotiated with all personnel who have taken reductions/deferrals to eliminate any contingent liabilities for EEC. ' 55 Again Mr Elliott did not respond to the memorandum of 31 October. He said in cross-examination: 'I always saw Maurice as a very senior gentleman. He'd run the company, he had all the capabilities to run and administer and put these things in place. No one was stopping him from doing that. We look to Mr Brand to take care of the Australian office and the operations here and to see that these things were in place and he was very familiar with all the staff and what had happened. ' His non-responsiveness to Mr Brand's memoranda is difficult to understand. It suggests a degree of detachment from the affairs of the company for which he was managing director. It may be that he was reliant largely upon Mr Jordan in relation to the affairs of Energy.    56 Mr Elliott's testimony conflicted significantly with the position taken by Energy in other litigation in the Federal Court between Energy and Maurice Hayes, another consultant employed by Energy. Mr Hayes sued Energy for termination payments and claims for arrears of salary due following voluntary reductions. The company's defence in that case depended, in part, upon the proposition that Mr Brand did not have authority to negotiate with Mr Hayes the conditions upon which he based his claim. Pressed with this inconsistency, Mr Elliott suggested that Mr Brand was free to make arrangements and organise the staff in Perth but would have to put such arrangements to the Board. Whether such proposals were accepted by the other Directors was '... obviously a part of the administration that we had put in place to control costs'. His responses did not resolve the apparent inconsistency between his testimony about his attitude to Mr Brand's authority and the position taken by the company in the litigation with Mr Hayes. 57 Mr Brand said that although he received no response from Mr Elliott to his memorandum of 7 October 2000 some of the changes he recommended seemed to 'evolve'. A number of those changes, which he listed, were a natural consequence of his replacement as managing director by Mr Elliott. Messrs. Lindsay and Hayes reported to Mr Elliott on financial, administrative and accounting matters. Mr Brand's responsibilities, which had previously covered all of Energy's Australian operations and its Indonesian and Indian operations, contracted to direct second tier responsibility for the proposed West Kimberley joint venture project and some smaller Western Australian development projects. In respect of these, he reported to Mr Elliott. 58 From shortly after September 2000 Energy's Australian operations staff, other than those involved with the West Kimberley project, reported to Mr Jordan. The gas venture staff reported to Mr Hornaday, who now reported to Mr Elliott. Energy's 'power and development executives' left the company in February 2001 and were not replaced. Energy had no construction activities although some of its construction staff moved into the West Kimberley project and the power project development team. 59 As Mr Brand saw the position generally he had, prior to September 2000, been responsible for about 80 people including operational staff at the company's gas and power project in India and the company and group's entire operation. By February 2001 his responsibility had shrunk to five staff and all consultants who assisted with the development of the West Kimberley project. By that time he was reporting to Mr Elliott. 60 While this was undoubtedly a matter of regret for Mr Brand it hardly gave him cause for complaint.    The reduction in his responsibility was a consequence of his necessary replacement as managing director by Mr Elliott. That in turn was a consequence of Mr Elliott's financial commitment to the company which was necessary for its survival. I accept that his substitution as Chief Executive of the company was also necessary to give it credibility with its principal financier, the CBA. Brand agrees to reduce fees to \\$180,000 --- October/November 2000 61 Mr Brand said in his evidence-in-chief that in late October or early November he met with Mr Jordan in Perth. Mr Jordan told him that Mr Elliott wanted Martech and other consultants to further reduce their fees. He agreed at a further meeting with Mr Jordan a day or two later that Martech would reduce its annual fee to \\$180,000 from 1 January 2001 in order to assist Energy with cashflow. Mr Jordan said in his evidence that he recalled the conversation with Mr Brand but not precisely when it had occurred. 62 On 3 November 2000 Mr Brand sent a short letter to the Directors of Energy in the following terms: 'Further to the recent request for reductions in consulting fees to assist the Company's cashflow position, Martech International Pty Ltd has agreed to reduce its consulting fee from \\$240,000 to \\$180,000 per annum, effective 1 January 2001. All other terms and conditions of the Consultancy Agreement between Martech International Pty Ltd and Energy Equity Corporation Ltd remain in force for the remaining period of the Contract. ' 63 At the annual general meeting of the company held on 29 November 2000 a shareholder asked what was being done about the 'unacceptable levels of remuneration to directors and senior management'. Mr Punch, who was in the chair at the meeting, replied that substantial adjustments to Management Remuneration had already been made. Messrs. Elliott, Jordan, Trayling, Brand, Adijanto and Punch were all re-elected as directors. The meeting also resolved to authorise the company to grant Convertible Notes, Shares and Options to Martech up to \\$100,000. Further consideration of organisation and remuneration --- January-September 2001 64 Martech rendered to Energy an invoice for the services it had provided in January 2001. According to Mr Brand, that invoice had not been paid by late February 2001. However, on 30 January 2001 Mr Lindsay had a discussion with Mr Elliott about the payment of consultants generally. He sent a fax to him on the same day following that discussion. In it he asked Mr Elliott to review a list of staff and to provide approval for their fees. The list included Mr Brand and Martech. It set out his commencement date with Energy as 1992 and his current contract as commencing on 1 January 1999 and expiring on 30 June 2003.    65 On 9 February 2001 Mr Brand wrote to Mr Elliott setting out a summary of staff consulting arrangements. In respect of each of Mark Lindsay, Maurice Hayes and Bill Hornaday he reported their agreement to reductions in their fees 'pending discussions on future arrangements'. In respect of operations staff, Richard Rutherford and Gelber Taco, he reported the extension of their base salaries '... pending discussion on future arrangements'. In respect of his own position he said simply: 'I would like to discuss my position'. In cross-examination Mr Elliott said that he understood the reductions referred to in the letter of 9 February 2001 would be permanent. He had said that to Mr Brand but did not recall exactly when. His view was that permanent cuts would form part of the 'go forward plan'. The evidence does not, in my opinion, establish that any statement was made by Mr Brand on his own behalf or that of other consultants reserving their rights to claim catch- up payments at some later time. Nor does it support any implication to that effect which, objectively speaking, should have been appreciated by Mr Elliott. 66 Mr Brand said in evidence-in-chief that on or about 23 February 2001 he had a meeting with Mr Elliott. He thought Mr Jordan was also present. Mr Elliott wanted the consultants to become employees of the company. He also said that the company should not be paying GST on invoices rendered by consultants. Mr Brand replied that Energy had sufficient input credits to be able to claim back GST paid in any event. Mr Elliott, however, maintained his position that GST would not be paid. While Mr Brand said he was prepared to become an employee of Energy he wanted existing arrangements to continue until the Agreement expired on 30 June 2003. He said that he would consider the basis upon which he might be prepared to become an employee of Energy and would provide Mr Elliott with details. Mr Elliott recalled saying, at around that time, that he did not believe Energy was obliged to pay GST in addition to the remuneration specified in the various consultancy agreements. He denied that Mr Brand said that he was prepared to become an employee of Energy but wanted existing arrangements to continue until 30 June 2003. I accept Mr Brand's account of this conversation as it was consistent with the terms of the letter that followed on 23 February 2001. This does not involve any finding about the legal status of Martech's Agreement at this time. 67 Mr Brand wrote to Mr Elliott on 23 February 2001 under the heading 'Remuneration Arrangements' and submitted points for his consideration expressed as follows: '1. Responsible to the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer. 2.    Executive Director responsibilities as nominated by the Managing Director. 3. That the existing Consultancy Agreement be amended to an annual fee of \\$180,000 inclusive of GST effective 1 January 2001 to its termination date of 30 June 2003, at which time any future employment would be on an employment basis as governed by the Energy Equity Corporation Ltd policy for employees. If acceptable, the existing January 2001 invoice will be cancelled and reissued on this basis. 4. That the termination provision with the existing Consulting Agreement be cancelled and that the date of service for termination be effective 1 January 2001 on the basis of one month for each year or part thereof to 30 June 2003. Thereafter, the provisions of the employee company policy apply with the effective date of 1 January 2001. 2. (sic)Subject to shareholder approval, that I can participate in the Company's Option Scheme. ' The letter concluded with the statement: 'It is my sincere desire to be part of the team instrumental in the successful restoration of value for EEC Shareholders. ' 68 Mr Jordan responded on behalf of Energy in a letter dated 5 March 2001. He said: 'I confirm our acceptance of your offer of termination of the Consultancy Agreement, and our intention to offer you employment with the company. ' He said that the terms and conditions of employment would be conveyed to Mr Brand in the near future for his consideration and acceptance. In the meantime payment was made '\\\"without prejudice\\\", on account'. 69 Mr Brand denied that he had, at any time in 2001, offered to terminate the Agreement between Energy and Martech. After 5 March 2001 Energy continued to pay the consultancy fee monthly and Martech continued to invoice it. He did not receive a reply to his letter of 23 February 2001 either orally or in writing. That aspect of his evidence was not disputed. Neither Mr Elliott nor Mr Jordan referred in their evidence-in-chief to the letter of 5 March 2001. In cross-examination Mr Elliott could not remember whether he did or did not respond to the letter of 23 February 2001. 70 Mr Brand said that throughout 2001 he felt increasingly excluded from the decision- making processes at Energy. The Board did not pay a significant role in its management. No budget was presented for 2000-2001. There were no monthly management accounts and reports presented after December 2000.    He said executive decisions were made by Mr Elliott and implemented by Mr Jordan. He himself was based in Perth and most executive decisions were made in Sydney without his involvement or the involvement of the Energy Board. Decisions in relation to strategic directions and funding plans were made largely without any consultation with him. This view of the company's operations in 2001 was denied by Mr Elliott who said in his evidence-in-chief that no important decisions were taken or implemented without Board approval. In cross-examination Mr Elliott initially said that after September 2000 Mr Jordan was responsible for 'part of the management' in Perth with Mr Brand. He denied that Mr Jordan had day-to-day control. Pressed with evidence he had given in other proceedings involving Mr Hayes, Mr Elliott agreed that he had designated Mr Jordan to take day-to-day control in Perth. He accepted the proposition that Mr Brand did not run the Perth office and then said that Mr Brand and Mr Jordan had worked out between them what parts they were each running. 71 In my opinion the reality throughout 2001 was that real authority in the Perth office had shifted from Mr Brand to Mr Jordan. Mr Jordan had, in effect, a direct line to the new Managing Director. The marginalising of Mr Brand is corroborated by Mr Elliott's failure to respond to his memoranda. I accept Mr Brand's evidence about his effective exclusion from decision-making processes in Energy in 2001. Rotation of Directors --- Proposal September 2001 72 On 25 September 2001 Mr Brand sent a memorandum to Mr Elliott pointing out that all the directors apart from Brian Allen had been elected by shareholders at the annual general meeting in 2000. As managing director, Mr Elliott would not be required to submit himself for re-election. However under cl 53 of the company's Constitution, two of the other six directors would be up for re-election in that year, 2001, two in 2002 and two in 2003. It was therefore necessary for the directors to decide who would rotate. In order to expedite the process he had asked the company's auditors, Ernst & Young, to draw lots for the names of the directors to determine who would come up for re- election in the three successive years. The results were as follows: 2001 Dr B Littlechild and Mr M Brand 2002 Mr I Jordan and Mr S Adijanto 2003 Mr R Punch and Mr B Willcocks 2004 Mr B Allen Mr Brand recommended that directors approve that procedure. This meant that he and Brian Littlechild would retire and, being eligible for re-election, would be nominated for election and included in the notice for the annual general meeting. The proposal was agreed to by the Directors. Mr Brand foreshadows retirement as a Director --- October 2001 73 A meeting of the Board of Energy was held on 22 October 2001 in Perth.    The Directors considered a draft notice for the annual general meeting to be held on 30 November 2001. They also discussed the collapse of the West Kimberley project for which Mr Brand had the oversight and management. As recorded in the minutes, the Board was informed, presumably by Mr Brand, that Western Power Corporation had terminated the project and reserved its rights. Costs to be written off as at 30 June 2001 were \\$2,086,355. Resolutions were passed by the Board for steps to be taken to protect any rights that Energy might have against other parties in respect of the project. There was no record in the minutes of any discussion of Mr Brand's ongoing role in Energy. 74 Mr Brand gave evidence of a meeting held later the same day between himself, Mr Elliott and Mr Jordan. He made notes of the meeting after it had concluded. He said the meeting was called to discuss the scaling down of Energy's Perth office and a transfer of a number of functions performed at it to the Sydney office. He said that in the course of the meeting Mr Elliott told him, in effect, that he should think about his future with Energy overnight and that they should meet the next day to discuss it. Mr Brand believed then that Mr Elliott did not want him to continue as a director of Energy. At that time, as a result of the balloting process which he had suggested, his term as an executive director was due to expire at the annual general meeting on 30 November 2001. He had offered himself for re-election. 75 Mr Elliott's evidence was that Mr Brand appeared 'visibly upset at the Board meeting that day'. As to the subsequent meeting on the same day, he remembered a discussion with Mr Brand and Mr Jordan about organisational and administrative changes which Energy should make in light of the collapse of the West Kimberley project. He recalled Mr Brand saying something to the effect that the Perth office should be closed and moved to Sydney and that various staff members should be terminated. He denied that he told him to think about his future overnight. Mr Brand recorded that suggestion in his notes of the meeting. In my opinion, it was, in the circumstances, inherently probable that Mr Elliott would make such a suggestion. 76 Mr Jordan recalled that at about the time of the Board meeting of 22 October 2001 he and Mr Elliott met with Mr Brand to discuss moving the centre of Energy's operations to Sydney. He had not, at that time, had any discussion with Mr Elliott about Mr Brand's position with the company. 77 A further meeting was held on 23 October 2001.    Mr Brand said they had some further discussions about the Perth office and agreed to meet on the following day to discuss the question of his directorship. 78 According to Mr Brand's account of their meeting on 24 October 2001, he told Messrs Elliott and Jordan that it was clear to him from their discussions over the previous two days and from the way in which Energy was now being managed, that Mr Elliott wanted a fresh start. He had not been included in various strategic management meetings and he believed that it was in the best interests of everyone for there to be an amicable parting of the ways. He said that he would withdraw his nomination for re-election as a director rather than put it to shareholders. According to Mr Brand, Mr Elliott said that he did not think that Mr Brand could continue as a director of Energy. Mr Brand replied that it would be pointless for him to continue with his nomination if EWI did not support it. Mr Elliott said that that was a matter for the directors of EWI and its shareholders, however he controlled EWI. 79 Mr Brand said that he then told Mr Elliott that he had been a director of Energy for 16 years since its formation and had been assured the year before and more recently of a continuing role with it. He said he had not been seeking alternative employment and that he had fully supported the management restructure since September 2000. While he was prepared to withdraw his nomination, a reasonable basis for him so doing would have to be agreed. 80 He claimed that Mr Elliott then raised a number of issues which were in the nature of complaints about his performance as managing director and as an executive director. These related to the CBA facility, legal action commenced against Energy by consultants for unpaid consultancy fees and the failure of the West Kimberley project. He responded to those issues and then said he wanted to conclude a number of reports he had to hand and would be able to do so by 30 November 2001. He wanted to see some payment, perhaps by way of an issue of shares and cash, to give him some time to find alternative employment. 81 Mr Brand said that Mr Elliott required a letter withdrawing his nomination by noon that day or else it would have to proceed to the annual general meeting. He wanted the letter to be independent of any negotiation of a severance arrangement. Mr Elliott said he was prepared to negotiate a severance agreement in good faith provided that Mr Brand assisted in the defence of legal proceedings brought by previous consultants of Energy for arrears of consultancy fees and for termination payments. Mr Brand said he would give an accurate account of events and would assist where possible. He prepared notes of that meeting, as he had of the other two. 82 Mr Brand's evidence was that he knew that if he did not have EWI's support his nomination as a director of Energy would not succeed.    He did not want to be humiliated in front of the shareholders. He had known many of them for many years. He therefore decided to accede to Mr Elliott's request and withdraw his nomination. This he did by a letter dated 24 October 2001. The letter baldly stated: 'I hereby advise that I do not offer myself for re-election at the Annual General Meeting of Energy Equity Corporation Ltd on 30 November 2001. Accordingly, please withdraw my nomination from the Notice of Meeting. My Directorship of EEC therefore ceases on 30 November 2001. ' The letter was immediately circulated by Mr Jordan under cover of a fax dated 24 October 2001 to Mr Elliott and the other directors of Energy. 83 In his evidence-in-chief Mr Elliott denied that he had agreed, on 23 October 2001, to meet with Mr Brand on 24 October 2001 to discuss his directorship. He denied without qualification Mr Brand's account of their conversation about the need for him to cease to be a director of EWI. He denied Mr Brand's evidence that he was required to provide a letter withdrawing his nomination as a director by noon that day. As to Mr Brand's statement that Mr Elliott raised complaints about his performance, this too was denied. According to Mr Elliott he had no further personal contact with Mr Brand after 22 or 23 October 2001. Mr Jordan, like Mr Elliott, denied that Mr Elliott had ever made, in his presence, the statements attributed to him by Mr Brand about not continuing as a director. 84 When cross-examined, Mr Brand agreed with the proposition that he had thought about his position prior to the meeting of 24 October 2001 and had come to the view that it was in everybody's best interests for there to be an amicable parting of the ways. He agreed to withdraw his nomination. He agreed it was his decision although he also said it was made only after he was advised that EWI would not vote for his re-election. While he contended that his experience within the LNG industry would have been beneficial to the company and said he mentioned that on 22 October, he did not offer any particular contribution. He agreed that there was no other project that he was able to offer at that stage to replace the West Kimberley project. He accepted that primarily as a result of the collapse of that project there was not a lot for him to do. 85 Mr Brand was pressed in cross-examination about his real reason for withdrawing his nomination. His position was that he had lost the support of EWI, as indicated by Mr Elliott. It was put to him, however, that his real reason for withdrawing his nomination was his wish to avoid being humiliated in front of shareholders whom he knew. He had formed the company in 1985 and by October 2001 the shares had fallen to 6 cents each from a peak of \\$1.60.    He also agreed that he had suggested in the course of discussions that the Perth office should be closed. He did not accept that that would mean the end of his role. 86 I found Mr Brand's evidence on this question less than convincing in the light of his own account of the discussions that he had at the meetings of 22, 23 and 24 October 2001. The evidence does not support the inference that Mr Elliott unequivocally withdrew his support for Mr Brand, or that Mr Brand's decision was based upon his perception of Mr Elliott's want of support. In my opinion, the evidence rather indicates that Mr Brand reached the conclusion in his own mind and in discussions with Mr Elliott, that his position as a director of the company was no longer tenable. I make that finding on the basis that there was a discussion at the meeting of 24 October 2001 along the general lines indicated by Mr Brand. It is also consistent with his state of mind at the time that, as I have found to be the fact, he had been effectively marginalised in relation to Energy's operations after September 2000. I reject the evidence of Messrs Elliott and Jordan in so far as they deny that any such discussion took place. It seems to me to have been inherently probable that at that time, the very day that notices for the annual general meeting were to be issued, it was appropriate and practical to undertake a discussion of Mr Brand's future with the company. The PY-1 Gas Field Interest, Energy's default and duty of disclosure 87 In 2001 Energy Equity India Petroleum Pty Ltd (EEIP), a subsidiary of Energy, held a 35% interest in a gas permit, PY-1, in India under a Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) with the operator of the gas field covered by the permit. The operator was Mosbacher India LLC (Mosbacher). The other party to the JOA was Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Ltd (Hindustan). The JOA was originally made in October 1996 between Mosbacher, Hindustan and Petrodyne Inc. I infer that EEIP bought into the JOA at some earlier date which is not material for present purposes. As at 30 June 2001 the carrying value of the EEIP interest in the PY-1 gas field was shown in Energy's balance sheet as \\$13.4 million. At that time Energy's net assets were about \\$125 million. 88 It appears that by March 2001 EEIP had failed to meet cash contribution obligations under the JOA. An arrears notice was issued by Mosbacher. Mr Elliott spoke by telephone to one of its principals, Mr Rob Mosbacher, early in March and they agreed that EEIP could make up its shortfall of some \\$150,000 in instalments. Mr Elliott had a meeting with Mr Mosbacher and Walter Glasgow, the other principal of Mosbacher, on 31 March 2001.    It appears however that Energy's difficulties were only temporarily abated. 89 On 22 August 2001 Mosbacher gave notice that under Article 8.1 of the JOA that EEIP was in arrears because of its failure to pay cash calls. The amount of the arrears was \\$US47,095.10. The notice, which was sent to Messrs Elliott and Jordan, stated that EEIP had remedies under the terms of the JOA in order to avoid default. These involved either demonstrating to the satisfaction of Mosbacher and Hindustan that the failure to pay was due to government hindrance or to pay the amounts due, with accrued interest, within 15 days of receipt of the notice. A default notice was issued by Mosbacher on 13 September 2001. 90 On 28 September 2001 Mosbacher sent a Withdrawal Notice to Elliott and Jordan citing EEIP's default by way of its failure to pay arrears due. The notice stated: 'Pursuant to Article 8.8 of the Joint Operating Agreement governing the PY-1 Contract Area, Mosbacher India, as Operator of record hereby notifies Energy Equity that Energy Equity as a Defaulting Party is required to completely withdraw from the Joint Operating Agreement and the Production Sharing Contract governing the PY-1 Contract Area. The effective date of withdrawal shall be October 1, 2001 as the first business day following receipt of this notice. ' 91 Mr Jordan communicated with Mosbacher to try to negotiate the payment of the arrears and the cancellation of the Withdrawal Notice. He sent a fax to Mr Glasgow on 2 October 2001 and followed up with a phone call. The response he received was not encouraging. Mr Glasgow sent him an email on 3 October 2001 pointing out that Energy had been in arrears three times in the previous two years. Although Energy had been allowed time to pay it was again in arrears in August. He referred to Energy's failure to respond to Mosbacher's previous notices and said had there been some response there might have been some grounds upon which they could have worked the matter out. 92 Mr Elliott responded directly to Mr Glasgow's communication by an email dated 4 October 2001. He pointed out that the earlier notices had not been brought to the attention of Mr Jordan or himself. He referred to the restructuring of Energy and the relocation of its registered office to Sydney. In a reply dated 4 October 2001 Mr Glasgow pointed out that the notices were both faxed and delivered via FedEx or registered mail to Mr Elliott at Energy's 'address of record'. Mr Elliott had a further telephone conversation with Mr Glasgow on 12 October 2001 and followed up with a letter of that date offering to meet with Mr Mosbacher in November 2001.    He referred to a current investigation 'through legal channels' of 'the delicate matter discussed with regard to our former consultants'. He sought confirmation that upon receipt of the arrears Mosbacher would withdraw the default and withdrawal notices. Mosbacher replied on 15 October 2001 saying that payment of the arrears would not result in withdrawal of the notices. 93 Despite these unpromising responses Mr Elliott said in his evidence-in-chief that because he had resolved issues in the past with Mosbacher he was optimistic that he could resolve things at a face to face meeting proposed for 5 December 2001 in the United States. 94 Mr Brand did not become aware of the Withdrawal Notice until about 8 October 2001. The effect of the Notice, as he understood it, was to require EEIP to transfer its 35% interest in the PY-1 gas field to Mosbacher for no consideration. On 15 October 2001 he sent a fax to Messrs. Elliott and Jordan and to Mr Brian Allen in which he said that it was arguable that the ASX should be notified. He also stated that the CBA should be notified and the Withdrawal Notice would have to be mentioned in the Prospectus/Information Memorandum/Independent Expert's Report in relation to the forth coming Share Offer. He was concerned that Messrs. Elliott and Allen had signed a Representation Letter to Ernst & Young on 5 October 2001 and that Mr Elliott had signed financial statements as at 5 October 2001 with no reference to the Withdrawal Notice. 95 At the meeting of the Board of Directors held on 22 October 2001 the directors were advised of the Withdrawal Notice. The minutes recorded that: 'In view of the fact that the Notice had been only served by one party and any process and action was currently incomplete, it was considered that, at this point in time, it did not warrant a separate ASX disclosure. Reference to the Withdrawal Notice would need to be incorporated into the Information Memorandum and Prospectus. ' Energy's directors had signed off on the financial accounts for the year ending 30 June 2001 on 5 October 2001. The auditors had signed off on them on 8 October 2001. The Board, he said, was not advised of the Withdrawal Notice prior to the accounts being signed off. 96 At this time Energy was finalising an Explanatory Memorandum to go to shareholders for the annual general meeting to be held on 30 November 2001. The memorandum related, amongst other things, to a proposed rights issue to raise \\$11.331 million on the basis of the issue of one new share for every four existing shares at a price of \\$0.0665 per share. 97 Mr Brand was Chairman of the Due Diligence Committee which was responsible for overseeing the preparation of the disclosure documents relating to the Share Offer. When he sent his fax of 15 October 2001 he expected that the dispute with Mosbacher would be resolved as only a small amount of money had to be paid and there had been a good relationship between Energy and Mosbacher previously.    98 On 26 October 2001 the Directors passed a Circular Resolution authorising the distribution of a Notice of the Annual General Meeting together with an Explanatory Memorandum and Independent Expert's Report to shareholders together with the Annual Report. The Board also resolved that Energy announce its proposed non-renounceable share offer to raise \\$11.331 million on the basis of a 1 for 4 issue at an issue price of 6.65 cents per share. The offer was to close on 7 December 2001. Mr Punch was authorised to sign the Prospectus to be dated 29 October 2001. 99 On 29 October 2001 the Due Diligence Committee comprising Messrs. Jordan, Allen, Brand and Ms Ling signed its final report to the effect that it had prepared the prospectus dated 29 October 2001 and considered that it contained no material omission or error or misrepresentation known to the members of the Committee at that date. Mr Brand said that at this time he was still expecting the situation with Mosbacher would be resolved. 100 The Notice of Annual General Meeting was accompanied by an Explanatory Memorandum and Independent Expert's Report. In the Explanatory Memorandum at p 16 there was a note referring to the PY-1 gas permit which stated: 'Energy Equity India Petroleum Pty Ltd (EEIP), a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Equity Corporation Ltd (EEC) advises that it has received a Withdrawal Notice from one of the parties to the Joint Operating Agreement, Mosbacher India LLC. EEIP and EEC are currently reviewing its position and will take whatever action is required to protect Company and Shareholders interests in the PY-1 Gasfield. ' 101 Mr Brand was cross-examined on this entry. He had seen it before it appeared in the printed version of the Explanatory Memorandum. 102 A similar statement appeared at p 15 of the Prospectus for the share offer. 103 On 9 November 2001 Mr Brand sent a memo to other members of the Due Diligence Committee. In that memorandum he expressed his concern that the disclosure relating to PY-1 in the Prospectus was inadequate and that the Committee should consider the matter. He asked the other members to advise him urgently of the position from their perspective. He said: 'The reasons for my concern is that in the 2000 and 2001 Annual Reports, the Company has highlighted PY-1 as having substantial value and indeed is carried in the accounts at some \\$13 million or approximately 10% of net assets as at 30 June 2001. It is a key asset (and in my opinion, second to Sengkang in terms of future Shareholder value). Careful consideration should therefore be given within that context in terms of the adequacy of our disclosure.    ' He noted that the Prospectus had been printed and would be dispatched on Monday, 12 November or at the latest, Tuesday 13 November. Mr Punch had advised Mr Jordan and himself that he wanted the Board to agree to the document and that everything was in order prior to the dispatch on 12 November. He asked the other members of the committee to discuss the matter with him first thing Monday morning. 104 Mr Jordan sent a memorandum to the directors of Energy enclosing a copy of the final report of the Due Diligence Committee. He reported that the CBA had been advised of the default issue in relation to PY-1. He indicated that should the position with PY-1 not be satisfactorily resolved, further disclosure during the prospectus period might be required. He asked all directors to sign an attached Circular Resolution. The resolution was that the Directors had received and accepted the report of the Due Diligence Committee and that they approved the mailing of the Prospectus to shareholders. 105 Mr Brand said in his evidence-in-chief that he was still concerned about the PY-1 disclosure. However Mr Jordan told him that Mr Elliott was meeting with Mosbacher and would sort out the issue of the Withdrawal Notice. Mr Brand said he also believed that if it were not resolved adequate disclosure could be made. The Circular Resolution was executed. The Prospectus was then distributed. 106 It appears that on or about 9 November 2001 Mr Jordan had sent a fax to Mosbacher about the capital raising. Mosbacher responded on 12 November 2001 over the signature of Mr Glasgow, stating that they had not been aware of the fund raising process. It did not however excuse non-performance under the JOA. The history of default was repeated in the letter. The letter concluded by observing that if Mr Elliott were to be in the US within the next six weeks Mosbacher would be pleased to meet with him to discuss matters, referred to in the letter, which appear to have had no bearing on PY-1. 107 Mr Elliott sent a reply fax on 13 November 2001 to Mr Glasgow. He confirmed that he was planning a visit to the US. He said he would appreciate Mr Glasgow alerting Mr Mosbacher to his travel plans and confirming that a meeting could be organised with him during the week of 3 December 2001. Mr Elliott said he wanted to discuss in detail Energy's ongoing involvement in the PY-1 JOA, inter alia. He said: 'My intention is that during the course of our discussions, we can find a mutual solution to various outstanding matters with the aim to place our joint working relationship onto a go forward basis.    ' 108 On 15 November 2001 Mr Brand wrote to Energy's solicitor, Mr Tim Wong of Corrs Chambers Westgarth. He set out the history of the PY-1 arrears default and withdrawal notices and the issue of the Explanatory Memorandum and Prospectus. He said, inter alia: 'On 5 October 2001, EEC signed the year end accounts and on 8 October 2001 the Auditors signed. Neither the EEC Board nor the Auditors were advised, yet the Directors who knew signed Representation Letters to the Auditors. The Board of EEC were advised of the issue at the Board Meeting on 22 October 2001. As an Executive Director I became aware on 10 October 2001. ' He noted the JOA was governed by Indian law and the dispute with Mosbacher could take years to resolve. He expressed his belief that the implications of the withdrawal notice could raise further market speculation with respect to Energy. He said: 'Whilst I believe that the current share price would not be materially affected by EEC spelling out the problem, the asset is considered by many shareholders to represent 'blue sky' and would materially affect the share price once a Gas Sales Agreement is signed for the substantial proved reserves. ' Mr Brand expressed his opinion that there may have been a 'material omission' in the Explanatory Memorandum/Prospectus. He sought legal advice as to the adequacy of the disclosure. He said that depending on that advice and if other directors did not wish to make further disclosure his options were to withdraw his consent to the Prospectus and/or resign as a director and/or continue with his plan to step down on 30 November 2001. 109 On 16 November 2001 Mr Glasgow sent an email to Mr Elliott and stated that he and Mr Mosbacher would be available during the week of 3 December 2001 to discuss matters other than PY-1. The email said: 'As to PY-1, EEC's opportunity to cure its default expired on September 28 th, 2001, and under the terms of the PY-1 JOA is deemed to have withdrawn. ' 110 Mr Brand spoke with Mr Wong who told him that he could not provide him with advice as he acted on behalf of Energy. However, Mr Wong told him that the Act imposed strict obligations of disclosure on directors of matters material to share issues. Mr Brand said in his evidence-in-chief that he was more concerned about the adequacy of the Prospectus disclosure in relation to the Withdrawal Notice than the impact of the disclosure of the withdrawal notice on the share price on the ASX. He did not believe that the information would have a major impact on the traded price. 111 After he had spoken to Mr Wong, a long time shareholder, Mr Smyth, telephoned him and said that he was considering taking out his entitlement under the rights issue. According to Mr Brand, Mr Smyth told him that one of the reasons for doing so was the upside to the company represented by PY-1. Mr Brand considered he could not discuss the Withdrawal Notice with Mr Smyth.    However the conversation indicated to him that the future of the PY-1 gas field was a matter affecting shareholder perception of the value of Energy shares. This amplified his concerns about the adequacy of the company's disclosure. Mr Brand tenders an early resignation --- 19 November 2001 112 On the weekend of 17 and 18 November 2001, according to Mr Brand, he considered what he should do. He was due to cease being a director at the end of the month and was worried that once he was gone the Board would not make any further disclosures. He decided to resign over the issue. He was concerned to limit any personal liability he might have as much as possible. 113 In a letter dated 19 November 2001 to Mr Punch Mr Brand tendered his resignation, effective that day, as a director of Energy and associated companies. He also tendered his resignation as company secretary of Energy and associated companies. He attached another letter setting out the reasons for his resignation. The letter setting out the reasons for his resignation referred to the company's ASX Continuous Disclosure obligations and also the obligations of directors under s 730 of the Act. He said, inter alia: 'Accordingly, I believe that the EEC Directors should urgently request from the EEC Managing Director a written statement on the PY-1 position and determine, with written legal advice, as to whether the Prospectus should be updated by way of a Supplementary Prospectus or that the Share Offer is withdrawn. ' 114 Mr Brand went on to refer to other matters of which directors should be aware which 'whilst not exhaustive, should be of concern to the Board'. He referred, among other things, to the absence of any budget papers for 2001 and 2002. He noted that a complete proposal had not been presented to directors in June 2001 in relation to the refinancing of the Central Energy Power assets in Alice Springs. On 20 November 2001 he went to the office. Mr Jordan then told him that Mr Elliott had advised him that his services were no longer required and that he should leave Energy's offices immediately. In departing from the Energy offices Mr Brand sent a letter to Mr Jordan, dated 20 November 2001, in which he said: 'I refer to your instructions to me this morning that the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Energy Equity Corporation Ltd (EEC), Mr Stewart Elliott, had advised that my services were no longer required and that I was to leave immediately. My services are provided through a Service Agreement with Martech International Pty Ltd and accordingly EEC has terminated this Agreement. ' Mr Jordan sent a memorandum to Mr Elliott confirming that he had asked Mr Brand to leave. He said: 'I merely said it was inappropriate for him to be here since he had resigned yesterday. ' He denied saying that Mr Elliott had instructed him to say that.    115 In cross-examination of Mr Brand it was put to him that he had signed the final report of the Due Diligence Committee on 29 October 2001. That Committee had approved the prospectus. Yet 12 days later he was expressing his concerns that disclosure had been inadequate. Mr Brand said that they were continuing concerns. He agreed that there was no such concern expressed in the minutes of the Due Diligence Committee. He said there was some discussion about PY-1 at the meeting. In response to his memorandum to other members of the Due Diligence Committee there was a discussion on Monday 12 November 2001. That was evidently a telephone discussion. He did not recall that any minute was prepared. The Due Diligence Committee did not come to any different view. 116 It was put to Mr Brand that after he had withdrawn his nomination as a director in October he couldn't wait to leave Energy. He denied this. It was put to him that he wanted to find any hook he could possibly find to justify going earlier. He denied this also. It was put to him that in his statement of reasons for resignation he said that Energy's directors should urgently request a written statement on the PY-1 position and determine whether the prospectus should be updated. He accepted that he had not asked that this be done in order to satisfy his concerns. He didn't know whether any of that had happened. 117 In my opinion, while non-disclosure of the Withdrawal Notice may have been one of the stated justifications for Mr Brand's decision to resign, it was not the cause of that decision. I find that, having decided not to seek re-election as a director, he saw little or no point in staying on. The non-disclosure issue was a matter he relied upon, in part, to justify his decision. He himself was quite ambivalent about the question of disclosure as revealed by his own inconsistent approach to it. Energy considers disclosure of the Mosbacher dispute 118 In a memorandum to Mr Elliott dated 19 November 2001 Mr Jordan noted that while Mosbacher had issued the Withdrawal Notice it had not taken any further steps to enforce it. He said he believed that there was an avenue to reach agreement when Mr Elliott met with Mosbacher in the US in December 2001. He also advised Mr Elliott that the JOA was governed by the laws of India, with dispute resolution being either by a single expert or a board of arbitrators. Arbitration would take place in London under Uncitral Rules. 119 Mr Jordan met with Clayton Utz, the solicitors who had assisted Energy with the Prospectus on 21 November 2001.    He provided them with relevant documents in relation to the PY-1 gas field including the recent correspondence with Mosbacher and requested their advice in relation to the issues raised by Mr Brand in his letter of resignation. He received advice from Clayton Utz on 22 November 2001. That advice suggested that the Board's decision on disclosure might largely turn on its perception of Mosbacher's true intentions and whether that perception was reasonable. 120 On the same day Mr Jordan discussed Mr Brand's letter of resignation and the advice from Clayton Utz with Mr Punch. Mr Punch directed him to obtain advice from Corrs about any need to alter the Prospectus. Corrs had traditionally been Energy's lawyers. Mr Jordan also had discussions with Messrs. Elliott and Allen in relation to PY-1 and prepared and circulated an agenda for a Board meeting on 30 November 2001. 121 The advice from Corrs provided to Energy on 28 November 2001, described the situation as 'borderline'. They recommended that Energy seriously consider making a further ASX announcement as soon as practicable confirming that a meeting was scheduled for the following week in an attempt to resolve the situation as well as providing further details of the reasons for the Withdrawal Notice. 122 At the Board meeting held on 30 November 2001 directors were advised that a meeting had been arranged between Mr Elliott and Mr Mosbacher for 6 December 2001 in Houston. A draft Gas Sales Agreement had been prepared in 1999 and not finalised. Directors were told of the advice received from Clayton Utz and Corrs. Disclosure of the Withdrawal Notice issued by Mosbacher had been made in the Explanatory Memorandum and in the Prospectus. The minutes recorded the view that nothing further of material interest had occurred to require further disclosure. 123 In relation to Martech the minutes recorded that directors were advised by Mr Elliott that he had had discussions with Mr Brand and had agreed to have further discussions following the annual general meeting. It was agreed that the matter be left for the managing director to deal with. Mosbacher goes to arbitration 124 The scheduled meeting between Messrs. Elliott and Mosbacher in Houston did not eventuate when Mr Mosbacher did not attend. In January 2002 Energy received legal documents from Mosbacher which, if executed, would have effected EEIP's withdrawal from the PY-1 project. On 24 January 2002 Mosbacher issued a Notice of Arbitration under the Heads of Agreement. The dispute went to arbitration and on 27 March 2003 the London Court of International Arbitration delivered a Partial Award in respect of the Heads of Agreement in which it was held that Article 8.8 was a penalty within the meaning of s 74 of the Indian Contract Act.    On 9 December 2003 the London Court of Arbitration delivered its second and final Partial Award. Energy was awarded the sum of \\$3.1 million by way of compensation for the assessed value of its interest in the PY-1 project. Martech claims balance of fees 125 On 10 December 2001 Mr Brand wrote to Mr Elliott enclosing tax invoices for amounts he believed were then payable under the Martech consultancy agreement. He said in the letter that he was disappointed that Mr Jordan had not responded to an earlier letter he sent on 26 November 2001 and that he had not made contact with him after the Board meeting. The tax invoice enclosed was for the amount of \\$483,026 said to represent the balance of fees payable to 31 October 2001 and an amount payable to 20 November 2001. Also enclosed, in the name of Martech, was a tax invoice for \\$990,000 representing the termination fee said to be payable pursuant to cl 8.6 of the Service Agreement. 126 The invoice for amounts totalling \\$483,026 set out what was described as 'balance of fees' for the years 1999/2000, 2000/2001 and 1 July 2001 to 31 October 2001. The balance in each case appears to have been calculated on the assumption of a total entitlement of \\$500,000 per annum for each period. For the first two full year periods the amount in each case was \\$500,000 less fees paid. For the period 1 July 2001 to 31 October 2001 the total fees said to have been payable for the period were \\$166,666 against fees actually paid of \\$54,545. Fees payable for the period 1 November 2001 to 20 November 2001 were said to be \\$27,777. GST was claimed in each case, apart from the fees for the year 1999/2000 when GST did not apply. 127 Mr Jordan responded to Mr Brand on 17 December 2001 expressing his disappointment at Mr Brand's action as he understood he had agreed to discuss matters with a view to reaching a mutually agreed solution. He said: 'I totally disagree with the invoices which you have included and I am therefore returning the originals of your invoices with this letter, for you to reconsider. Please contact Stewart or myself after the holiday break to arrange discussions. ' 128 By a facsimile dated 6 November 2003 Martech issued further invoices to Energy in relation to amounts which, Mr Brand said he believed, after legal advice, were due and payable. These amounts totalled \\$1,498,983.53. In his covering letter he referred to earlier correspondence and discussions he had had with Mr Jordan on 14, 25 and 28 February 2002. The Agreement of 28 May 1999 129 The Agreement of 28 May 1999 was made between Energy and Martech. Energy (then known as Energy Equity Corporation Ltd) was referred to as the 'Company' in the Agreement. Martech was referred to as the 'Manager'.    130 The Agreement recited that Energy carried on the business of providing alternative energy packages utilising gas as the energy source and establishing energy activities. It also recited that in order to assist in the administration, management and financial control of the business of the company and the marketing of its products and services, Energy had requested Martech to provide the Specified Services which Martech was agreeable to do for the consideration and upon and subject to the covenants and conditions set out in the Agreement. 131 Clause 1 defined the term 'Specified Services' to be provided by Martech to Energy by reference to a definition in Item 1 in the Schedule to the Agreement. The services there defined were as follows: 'To provide the services of Managing Director of the Company including, but not limited to such services as the following: (a) To assist the Company in the administration management and financial control of the business of the Company and the marketing of its products; (b) To assist the Company in the formulation of policy for the more effective operation of its business; (c) To manage supervise control and co-ordinate personnel employed and contracted by the Company in its business and ensure performance of their respective obligations in an efficient and professional manner; (d) To perform the following services and keep and maintain documents reports and material relating thereof:- (i) to establish utilise and provide professional business management methods and efficient control of the business of the Company and make appropriate revisions thereto from time to time; (ii) to establish for the business of the Company appropriate accounting procedures and cost controls in a form suitable for audit; (iii) to prepare detailed development schedules for the Company and use all reasonable efforts to conform with the time constraints of such schedules; (iv) to co-ordinate direct and inspect all phases of the business of the Company. ' 132 The term of the Agreement was the period stipulated in Item 2 of the Schedule and that was: 'Four (4) years commencing on the 1 st day of July 1999 and thereafter renewable by mutual agreement of the parties hereto. ' The term 'Fee' was defined as the 'remuneration to be paid by the Company to the Manager pursuant to Clause 4'. 133 In cl 2.1 of the Agreement Energy engaged Martech to provide the Specified Services for the Term and upon the terms and conditions contained in the Agreement. Martech covenanted to carry out the Specified Services to the best of its skill and ability and would act under and in accordance with such lawful directions of Energy as should be given by Energy from time to time to Martech. Under cl 2.5 Martech covenanted with Energy that it would provide 'the full time services of Fletcher Maurice Brand to perform the Specified Services hereunder at all times during the term of this Agreement...'. Clause 4 provided for the payment of the Fee at the time and in the manner specified in Item 3 of the Schedule. 134 Clause 3.2 of the Agreement provided that: 'If: (a) one party or a number of associated parties (\\\"the control party\\\") acquires 25% or more of the issued capital of the Company; and (b) anytime thereafter the composition of the Board of Directors of the Company is altered so that a majority of the Directors are nominated or appointed    by the control party then: Each of the Company and the Manager shall within 90 days of both these events occurring have the right to terminate this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated by either party under the terms of this clause the Manager shall be paid out the balance of the Term of this Agreement from the date of termination together with any other accrued entitlements or paid for a minimum period of two years which ever is the greater. ' This clause was deleted from the Agreement by the Deed of Variation of 13 March 2000 on the basis that it appeared to be contrary to the Listing Rules of the ASX. 135 Clause 8 of the Agreement provided for its termination. The relevant parts of that clause were as follows: 8. Termination 8.1 The Company may (subject to clause 8.3 hereof) by notice in writing to the Manager terminate summarily the engagement of the Manager under this Agreement if:- 8.1.1 in the reasonable opinion of the Company the Manager is not carrying out the Specified Services in a manner satisfactory to the Company; 8.1.2 the services of the said Fletcher Maurice Brand are not provided for any consecutive period of three (3) months or his services are not available for any cumulative period of Four (4) months in any period of 12 months. 8.1.3 in the reasonable opinion of the Company the Manager has committed or is preparing to commit a serious or persistent breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement; 8.1.4 the Manager, goes into liquidation or receivership or suspends payment or compounds with or assigns its estate for the benefit of its creditors; and 8.1.5 the Manager or employee is convicted of a criminal offence carrying imprisonment as a possible penalty. 8.2 Subject to clause 8.3 hereof, the Manager may be (sic) notice in writing to the Company terminate summarily this Agreement if the Company suspends payment or compounds with or assigns the Company's estate for the benefit of the Company's creditors. 8.3 The Company or the Manager can only terminate this Agreement if all of the following provisions are complied with:- 8.3.1 the Company or the Manager is in breach of their respective obligations hereunder for a continuous period of thirty (30) days; 8.3.2 the Company or the Manager serves a written notice on the other demanding rectification of the breach within thirty (30) days of the date of service of such notice; and 8.3.3 the Company or the Manager (as the case may be) does not rectify the said breach within thirty (30) days of service of the notice provided for in the sub-clause 8.3.2. 8.4 Upon termination of this Agreement for whatever reason the Manager shall deliver to the Company or its authorised representative all records, accounts and other documents and property of the Company. 8.5 In the event of the Manager wishing to terminate its services hereunder the Manager may do so upon first giving to the Company three (3) months written notice of its intention so to do. 8.6 In the event that this Agreement is terminated for any other reason other than as stated in clauses 8.1.1, 8.1.3, 8.1.4, 8.1.5 and 8.5 hereof or clause 3.2 hereof or the    Term (as extended or renewed) is not renewed the Company shall pay to the Manager the Fee for a further period of twenty (20) months together with one (1) month for every complete year that this agreement operates calculated from the 1 st July 1999 to the date of termination or expiration. ' The reference in cl 8.6 to cl 3.2 was also deleted by the Variation of 13 March 2000. None of the other provisions of the Agreement are material for present purposes. Summary of principal findings of fact 136 The principal findings of fact which emerge from the preceding may be summarised as follows: 1. Mr Brand founded Energy in 1985 and acted as its Managing Director under a series of contracts from 1985 to 2000. 2. On 28 May 1999 Martech, a company controlled by Mr Brand, agreed with Energy to provide his services as Managing Director of Energy for a term of four years from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2003. 3. Under the agreement Martech was to be paid an annual fee of \\$500,000 for Mr Brand's services. 4. In late 1999 and early 2000 Energy was in financial difficulty. Its share price had declined significantly and its principal financier, the CBA, declined to extend the \\$115 million facility beyond 20 February 2000. 5. At a meeting of the Board of Energy held on 3 February 2000 proposed funding and underwriting of a rights issue by EWI was considered. Stewart Elliott was the Managing Director of EWI and was assisted generally by Mr Ian Jordan. 6. At the meeting of 3 February 2000 Mr Brand, on behalf of Martech, told the Board that he would reduce the fee for his services temporarily from \\$500,000 per annum to \\$300,000 per annum. 7. Mr Brand did not say at the Board meeting, nor was any agreement then made, that he would be compensated for the shortfall at a later time. 8. On 12 March 2000 the Board of Energy accepted EWI's proposal in principle. Under that proposal EWI was to make a \\$15 million advance to Energy by way of subordinated debt. 9. The agreement between Energy and Martech of 28 May 1999 was varied on 13 March 2000 by deleting cl 3.2 in order that the agreement would not be in breach of the Listing Rules of the ASX.    10. On 16 March 2000 Mr Brand wrote to Mr Elliott confirming the reduction in his remuneration without reference to any later catch-up compensation. 11. Martech thereafter issued monthly invoices for its fees at the reduced rate with no reference to any outstanding balance deferred. 12. Mr Brand told the Chairman of the Board, Ronald Punch, in July 2000 that he was prepared to continue with the reduced fees until 30 June 2001. 13. Mr Brand made arrangements with other Energy consultants under which they were paid at rates reduced below their consultancy agreements on the basis that their shortfalls would be paid when the EWI facility became available. 14. In mid-September 2000, at a meeting between Mr Elliott and Mr Brand, Mr Elliott said he wanted Mr Brand to relinquish his position as Managing Director of the company and become an Executive Director instead. 15. Mr Brand agreed to Mr Elliott's request. He did not assert any legal entitlement under the agreement of May 1\", TextAnalysis.DocumentMetadata(Languages.English(), \" Martech International Pty Ltd v Energy World Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 1004 (3 August 2006)  Introduction 1 In 1985 Mr Fletcher Brand set up a company now known as Energy World Corporation Ltd (Energy).\", \"\", \"2017-08-31T10:42:19Z\")), TextAnalysis.StringDocument{String}(\" Commissioner of Taxation v Milne (with Corrigendumdated 9 August 2006) [2006] FCA 1005 (4 August 2006)  Context to the present application by way of appeal from the Tribunal 1 This is an application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal, a division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') which was constituted by Senior Member Robin Hunt, being a decision made on 4 July 2005 whereby the Tribunal set aside the objection decision of the Commissioner and remitted those Tribunal proceedings to the Commissioner with the direction that the discretion of the Commissioner be exercised by way of the grant of appropriate relief in favour of the respondent ('Mr Milne') under section 340- 5 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('the Administration Act'). It appears that at one stage Mr Milne's estranged wife Lynette Milne was an additional applicant in the Tribunal proceedings, but subsequently she ceased to be so, at least by the time for the provision of written submissions to the Tribunal. 2 The grounds of the Commissioner's appeal to the Federal Court were in the following terms: (i) The Tribunal erred in law and applied the wrong test in holding that Mr Milne would suffer 'serious hardship' within the meaning of subsection 340-5(3) of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act if he was not released from that part of his tax debt which was eligible for release; (ii) The Tribunal erred in law by failing to take relevant considerations into account in the exercise of its power, namely: (a) that Mr Milne had an excess of assets over liabilities; (b) that upon the sale of Mr Milne's assets, he would have sufficient funds to discharge all of his debts including that part of his tax debt which was eligible for release; (c) that upon the sale of Mr Milne's assets, his likely income would exceed his liabilities; (d) that Mr Milne's assets included the sum of approximately \\$48,000 in cash; (e) that absent the sale of Mr Milne's assets, he would likely be made bankrupt and other creditors paid in preference to the applicant; (f) that the Tribunal had power to order a partial release of that part of Mr Milne's tax debt which was eligible for release; (g) that at the end of Mr Milne's working life (ie approximately three years hence), he would be required to sell his assets to discharge his liabilities in any event; (h) that Mr Milne's expenditure exceeded his income solely by reason of the fact that he was continuing to service loans secured against his unsold assets. (iii) the Tribunal erred in law in taking irrelevant considerations into account in the exercise of its power, namely: (a) that because Mr Milne had been earning a high level of income in the past from practice as a solicitor, and was still earning income in a higher bracket and had been able to acquire assets and to live reasonably well throughout his adverse business fortunes, it would not be fair to release him in the absence of 'special factors'; (b) that the 'special factors' in Mr Milne's case were his battle to continue to work despite poor health and the need to support his dependent son until he finished his schooling; (c) that Mr Milne's problems were beyond his control; (d) that absent a release, Mr Milne would be made bankrupt, would lose his practising certificate as a solicitor, and would not have the means to earn a living.    (iv) the Tribunal should have held that: (a) because Mr Milne was continuing to earn income in a higher bracket, was continuing to live reasonably well, and was continuing to use and enjoy assets acquired by him at the expense of the discharge of his taxation liabilities: (aa) Mr Milne would not suffer 'serious hardship'; (bb) it was unreasonable to exercise the Tribunal's discretion in favour of Mr Milne; (b) the sale of Mr Milne's assets would enable him to continue to support his dependent son until he finished his schooling; (c) that Mr Milne's problems were within his control in that they were caused by the maintenance of existing assets at the expense of his taxation liabilities; (d) that whether or not Mr Milne was released, he would likely face bankruptcy absent the sale of his assets; (v) the exercise of the Tribunal's power to release Mr Milne was unreasonable; and (vi) the Tribunal's finding that Mr Milne would suffer 'serious hardship' within the meaning of subs 340-5(3) of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act if he was not released from that part of his tax debt which was eligible for release, was not open as a matter of law on the basis of the evidence and materials before the Tribunal; 3 Part 4-50 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act, headed Release from particular liabilities , provides by way of Division 340, in turn headed Commissioner's power to provide release from particular liabilities , so far as presently material, as follows: '340-5 Release from particular liabilities in cases of serious hardship. Apply for release (1) You may apply to the Commissioner to release you, in whole or in part, from a liability of yours if section 340-10 applies to the liability. ... (3) The Commissioner may release you, in whole or in part, from the liability if you are a person specified in the column headed \\\"Person\\\" of the following table and the condition specified in the column headed \\\"Conditions\\\" of the table is satisfied: Person and condition Item Person Condition 1 an individual you would suffer serious hardship if you were required to satisfy the liability ... (4) If the Commissioner: (a) refuses to release you in whole from the liability; or (b) releases you in part from the liability; nothing in this section prevents you from making a further application or applications under subsection (1) in relation to the liability. ... 340-15 Commissioner may take action to give effect to a release decision (1) If the Commissioner decides to release you from a liability to which section 340-10 applies, the Commissioner may take such action as is necessary to give effect to the decision. ' The reference above to the condition of ' serious hardship... if required to satisfy the liability' may thus be observed. 4 As to whether facts as found fall within the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute, the same normally involves an issue of law. Thus for instance in NSW Associated Blue-Metal Quarries Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1955] HCA 23 ; (1956) 94 CLR 509 at 512, Kitto J observed as follows: 'The next question must be whether the material before the Court reasonably admits of different conclusions as to whether the appellant's operations fall within the ordinary meaning of the words as so determined; and that is a question of law... If different conclusions are reasonably possible, it is necessary to decide which is the correct conclusion; and that is a question of fact... .    ' 5 On 11 December 2000, Mr Milne made application for release of his income taxation liability for the fiscal years ended 30 June 1991 to 30 June 1999 (inclusive). He was examined by the Tribunal and a report of that examination was forwarded to the Taxation Relief Board ('the Board') on 16 October 2001. Subsequently on 25 October 2001, the Board granted Mr Milne partial relief from his then income taxation indebtedness to the Commissioner. There was no evidence that such taxation indebtedness was incurred in consequence of Mr Milne's engagement in taxation avoidance or in any taxation scheme of any kind. The total amount of income tax indebtedness the subject of the Board's consideration was \\$89,547.10, and the extent of the relief so granted was \\$37,532.48. The Board's reasons for decision were as follows: 'The Board considered that the applicant could make a genuine attempt to repay a part of the debt by instalments without being deprived of the necessities mentioned above (food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements). In reaching this decision, the Board noted that two separate statements contained in the AAT report pointed to the capacity of the applicant to pay up to \\$50,000 toward the debt. ' 6 Subsequently on 24 October 2003, Mr Milne made a further application for release from his income tax liability, by that time amounting to \\$96,062.62, relating to the fiscal years 30 June 1993 to 30 June 2002 (inclusive). The context to that further application included the prior service of a bankruptcy notice in February 2003 and of a creditor's petition on 18 June 2003, in each case at the instance of the Commissioner. The application for release was rejected by the Commissioner on 23 February 2004, and Mr Milne applied to the Tribunal, on 25 February 2004 for review of that second decision, pursuant to Part IVC of the Administration Act headed Taxation objections, reviews and appeals. By the time of the hearing by the Tribunal of that review application on 9 May 2005, according to the Commissioner's evidence, the tax debt had increased to \\$187,430.25, whereof the amount eligible for release amounted to \\$149,876.68. Moreover the Commissioner indicated to the Tribunal that a further \\$15,895 would become due for payment on 12 May 2005, and that there might well be future unspecified taxation debts. 7 The application for review was heard by the Tribunal on 9 May 2005 and on 4 July 2005 the Tribunal determined that the Commissioner's decision should be set aside and the matter be remitted to the Commissioner with the direction that discretion be exercised by way of grant of relief in favour of Mr Milne pursuant to section 340-5 of the Administration Act. Of course no order was made as to costs. Hence the Commissioner's present application to this Court is for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision of 4 July 2005 by way of appeal under the Administration Act. 8 A statement of assets and liabilities of Mr Milne in evidence, which he prepared and verified as at 4 November 2004, disclosed the following situation: Assets Residence comprising 31 Harley Crescent Eastwood in the State of New South Wales owned by    himself and his wife in equal shares, the value of his half share being \\$375,000.00 Cottage comprising 'Hillside' Brindabella in the State of New South Wales also owned by himself and his wife in equal shares, the value of his half share being \\$130,000.00 1982 Toyota Landcruiser motor vehicle \\$2,000.00 2001 Honda CR-V motor vehicle (held indirectly by a family company whereof Mr Milne and Mrs Milne were equal shareholders) \\$10,500.00 204 shares in AMP Society (obtained from the demutualisation in favour of policy holders) \\$1,200.00 Household furniture and effects \\$5,000.00 \\$523,700.00 (In addition, Mr Milne asserted that he maintained a cheque account with National Australia Bank into which he deposited his income derived as a solicitor, the amount in credit varying from \\$10.00 to 'a few thousand depending upon whether I have had drawings for that particular fortnight'). Liabilities Mortgage indebtedness in favour of Banksia Mortgages Limited secured upon the Eastwood and Brindabella properties (which replaced his former indebtedness to the National Bank and Citibank) \\$750,000.00 Hire purchase debt due to Honda Finance \\$13,742.00 American Express (average variable debt) \\$14,000.00 David Jones (average variable) \\$7,000.00 Loreto Normanhurst --- judgment debt for unpaid school fees \\$6,500.00 \\$791,242.00 9 However the Commissioner prepared a corresponding schedule which reflected merely one month earlier the joint assets and liabilities of Mr Milne and Mrs Milne, which stated as follows: Assets Real Estate --- 31 Harley Crescent Eastwood --- Jointly owned \\$750,000.00 Real Estate --- \\\"Hillside\\\", Brindabella --- Jointly owned \\$260,000.00 2001 Honda CR-V (sole asset of Milsal Pty Limited) \\$21,000.00 1982 Toyota Landcruiser \\$2,000.00 204 AMP shares \\$1,200.00 Household furniture and effects \\$50,000.00 \\$1,084,200.00 Liabilities Mortgage to National Australia Bank secured over Eastwood and Brindabella \\$528,000.00 Overdraft --- National Australia Bank --- secured over Eastwood and Brindabella \\$72,500.00 Hire purchase --- Honda \\$12,400.00 Visacard --- Citibank (account closed) \\$17,500.00 Mastercard --- NAB (account closed) \\$16,500.00 American Express \\$14,000.00 David Jones \\$7,000.00 Loreto Normanhurst \\$6,500.00 \\$674,400.00 10 Upon the footing of that latter material, the Commissioner submitted that '... whatever calculation is used, it is clear that [Mr Milne] had sufficient assets to discharge his tax liability without bankruptcy'. The evident problem with that analysis is that both items of realty and the Honda motor vehicle were jointly owned at all material times by Mr and Mrs Milne, and for what it may ultimately matter, they have been living seemingly at all material times in a state of marital separation, with all the implications thereby involved. Moreover of course, Mr Milne is doubtless jointly and severally liable to those mortgages and there is no evidence moreover as to his wife's financial capacity to meet one half of those liabilities in the event of any shortfall on any sale of those assets or otherwise. The Tribunal's reasons for decision 11 In the reasons for decision of the Tribunal below, there was recorded a detailed outline of the evidentiary material, including non- contentious as well as contentious circumstances. That material may be summarised as follows: (i) though Mr Milne was previously granted a partial release by the Taxation Relief Board in 2001, he continued    to experience financial difficulties, the same arising largely in relation to fiscal outstandings in respect of the 1993 fiscal year and following; (ii) Mr Milne's financial difficulties stemmed from two major factors, the first being the extent of fraudulent misappropriation of funds by his former partner of their legal practice, in relation to which Mr Milne found it necessary to borrow in the course of the 1988-1989 financial year in excess of \\$300,000 in order 'to cover his share of the loss' , to use the Tribunal's description, and the second being his borrowing of \\$190,000 in order to finance his acquisition in 1991 of a partnership interest in another firm of solicitors; (iii) Mr Milne suffered a compounding of his continuing financial difficulties by departing from the latter firm of solicitors in March 1996 'without any return of the working capital of the partnership' ; that absence of any working capital return occurred apparently because '[h]is share of the taxable income of the partnership exceeded his drawings' ; since then however he has continued in legal practice as a sole practitioner pursuant to an arrangement whereby he has shared certain office and other administrative outgoings; and (iv) Mr Milne has suffered from poor and deteriorating health, apparently originating in 1996, involving a number of heart attacks, a quadruple coronary artery by-pass operation, and moreover as a consequence of osteoarthritis, he underwent a total replacement of both hips and corrective spinal surgery; additionally he has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease; those obviously serious illnesses and disabilities have occasioned not just substantial medical expense, but also substantial loss of income, not only by reason of his absence from work as a consequence of such illnesses and disabilities but also by reason of the need to bear the entirety of the ongoing of his sole legal practice at all times during his absences occasioned by those unfortunate circumstances. 12 I interpolate to observe that given the stark reality of those circumstances and their implications, it is apparent that any bankruptcy of Mr Milne at any prospective time thereof would yield no or at least only an insignificant dividend available for the Commissioner of Taxation as a preferential unsecured creditor in any bankruptcy of Mr Milne. In any event it was the Commissioner's case that Mr Milne would not be deprived of an ongoing capacity to earn income as a solicitor, irrespective of bankruptcy, though subject to prevailing Law Society conditions, including the condition of impermissibility to conduct a trust account. It was also said by senior counsel for the Commissioner that a condition of continuation in practice as a bankrupt would be '... whether in all the circumstances... the act of bankruptcy [was] such... that the person wasn't fit and proper to continue practice'. 13 As to Mr Milne's consequential financial situation, in terms of assets and liabilities, as found by the Tribunal, I would reproduce below certain of its more critical findings, rather than endeavour to summarise the same: '13. As to his assets, Mr Milne agreed with the Commissioner's estimate that his and his estranged wife's total assets listed on 30 September 2004 amounted to a value of \\$1,084,200. The assets included the family home, a holiday house at Brindabella, two vehicles, a small parcel of shares and household effects.    Mr Milne said he now had only one vehicle whereas previous information supplied showed he had two vehicles at an earlier time. Liabilities included a mortgage of the family home, an overdraft and credit cards. The mortgage of the family home was in both Mr and Mrs Milne's names. At the time of the objection decision under review, Mr Milne's wife was contributing to the household expenses. However, Mr Milne gave evidence that his wife, although earning some income, no longer contributed to the household expenses since the separation. Mr Milne said that he no longer paid school fees as his son was no longer attending the same school. He also no longer paid a vehicle hire purchase. 14. Concerning his assets, Mr Milne provided information that he and his estranged wife had formerly listed the family home for sale but it was no longer on the market. He produced a letter from an estate agent stating that there was no interest from potential purchasers in the holiday property at Brindabella. Further, a licensed valuer furnished a report that the former valuation of the Brindabella property was now excessive. Mr Milne claimed the value attributed by the Commissioner was overstated. The valuer's report, dated 7 April 2005, was before the Tribunal and explained what the valuer saw as the reality in the present market and that the property was now worth even less than previously reported. Mr Milne told the Tribunal this was due to the drought and the Canberra bushfires. He was unable to realise the property and its value had diminished. It had been valued at \\$260,000 but was not currently marketable. The licensed valuer suggested a revised figure of \\$235,000 and suggested it would take at least six months to find a buyer at this price, especially in winter. In addition, Mr Milne pointed out the family assets were jointly owned with his estranged wife. ' The severity of those Canberra bushfires was of course the subject of extensive reporting by the media of this country. It appears that the Tribunal's decision below was made three months after the Brindabella property valuation was completed. The Australian Taxation Office Receivables Policy and Income Tax Ruling No IT 2440 14 The Tribunal pointed out that the statutory notion of serious hardship is not defined in the Administration Act. The Commissioner has however formulated and published the Australian Taxation Office Receivables Policy ('the Receivables Policy'), which provides at par 24.4.1 as follows: 'The term serious hardship is not defined in the law and must be given its ordinary meaning. In determining the existence of serious hardship, the Board applies several tests that follow a conceptual position that the term serious hardship has connotations of unduly burdensome consequences, the magnitude of which would be likely to lead to persons being deprived of necessities according to normal community standards.    Thus, serious hardship would seem to exist where payment of tax liability would result in the debtor being left without the means to achieve reasonable acquisition of food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements. ' The references to accommodation and education for children may be observed. It is not stated explicitly, nor need be construed implicitly, that the statutory notion there of accommodation must necessarily be realty individually or jointly owned by a taxpayer. It is moreover not an irrelevant matter that to change unwillingly from freehold accommodation, particularly when held and occupied for a considerable period of time, to tenanted accommodation, might well have disadvantageous consequences to a taxpayer, particularly a taxpayer having one or more family dependants or partial dependants. 15 Thereafter the Tribunal referred to par 11 of Taxation Ruling No IT 2440 ('TR 2440'), in so far as it contains what the Tribunal described as '... three tests for considering a taxpayer's ability to meet a taxation liability from current income...', which are as follows : '(i) What is the debtor's capacity to pay, as measured by the income and outgoings stated in the application or supporting documents i.e. what net income remains after deducting total outgoings from total income? (ii) Does the Commissioner accept that the income and outgoings stated are accurate and that the outgoings are necessary, or is there scope to increase the net income available or to reduce outgoings to meet the tax debt without serious detriment to living standards? (iii) Is there a margin by which available income exceeds reasonable outgoings, and is it sufficient to allow the liability to be met within an acceptable time scale? ' The foregoing reference to the notion '... without serious detriment to living standards' may be observed. That notion would be objective in operation. 16 The Commissioner drew attention to par 6 of TR 2440, to which I add reference to pars 7, 8 and 9, each reading as follows: '6. The several tests applied by the Relief Board follow from a conceptual position that the term serious hardship has connotations of unduly burdensome consequences, the magnitude of which would be likely to lead to persons being deprived of necessities according to normal community standards. Thus, serious hardship would be seen to exist where payment of a tax liability would result in the taxpayer being left without the means to achieve reasonable acquisitions of food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements. 7. On the other hand, elements of hardship may be regarded as marginal or minor rather than serious if the consequences of payment of tax are seen, for example, as limitation of social activities or entertainment, or loss of access to goods or services of a more luxurious nature or standard. 8.    As a first step in considering an application for relief, the Relief Board must determine the person or persons to be included in its assessment of hardship factors. Although hardship will be largely personal to the taxpayer, or the dependant of a deceased taxpayer, it is not limited to the immediate state of that person. Rather, the prospect of inability to provide food, clothing, etc. for family members or others for whom the person has responsibility will also constitute a hardship faced by the person. 9. Conversely, although a taxpayer's immediate situation may suggest inability to meet the combined total of the tax debt and family expenditures, that factor will not indicate hardship if the income or asset positions of other members of the family are such as to suggest that the taxpayer cannot reasonably be regarded as responsible for all relevant outgoings. For example, the separate earnings, allowances or benefits received by other family members will be relevant to an assessment of the taxpayer's overall financial circumstances. ' The reference in [9] above to hardship being largely personal to the taxpayer may be observed. 17 The Tribunal next referred to the ' two stage process ' identified and discussed by Member Trowse in Re Filsell and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 1012 in the following context of his consideration of the implications of s 340-5(3) of the Administration Act: 'In the Tribunal's opinion, the language of the legislation requires a two stage approach. First, the decision-maker must decide whether the settlement of the liability will result in serious hardship. If that decision is favourable to the applicant, the discretion offered by sub-section 340-5(3) then falls for consideration. In reaching the decision to release in whole or part, the question to be addressed is whether, in all the circumstances, it is just and proper to provide the requested relief. Matters pertaining to the incidence and consequence of the tax and the effect of its exaction upon the affairs of the person will bear upon the issue of whether the relief is just and proper. Support for the two stage approach is to be found in the decision of the High Court in Rex v Trebilco; ex parte F.S. Falkiner & Sons Ltd [1936] HCA 63 ; (1936) 56 CLR 20 . ' I have of course extracted s 340-5(3) of the Administration Act earlier in these reasons. I would respectfully seek to apply that principled approach. 18 As to the notion of serious hardship above addressed in Filsell , the Tribunal below drew attention to Re Wilson and Minister for Territories (1985) 7 ALD 225, where Deputy President Hall discussed (at 229) the meaning of the similar notion of undue hardship, in the context of exercise of the statutory discretion of the Minister to discharge a liability for payment of rates on the ground of undue hardship, being a meaning said by Deputy President Hall to connote something more severe than substantial hardship .    The Tribunal below also discussed Deputy President Hall's view that undue hardship means 'hardship that is excessive in the circumstances', and that 'foreseeability and control' constitute 'relevant considerations' to the determination of hardship . Understandably Deputy President Hall further observed that neither expression undue hardship nor substantial hardship is susceptible to 'precise quantification' . The rationalisation of authorities undertaken in Re Wilson has provided assistance to later administrative decisions concerning this and analogous legislative provisions. 19 In relation to the notion of control over a taxpayer's circumstances, inherent implicitly in relation to the application of the tests the subject of TR 2440, the Tribunal below referred to 'Mr Milne's evidence... that a series of business catastrophes left him with debts which he could not control' , and in particular that '[h]is financial position was adversely affected by the fraud of a former partner' , and thereafter by 'poor financial performance of his next partnership venture and then by his chamber practice's expenses outweighing his ability to earn due to absences through ill health' , each being eventualities in relation to which the Tribunal observed that Mr Milne 'was unable to control' . Those are material findings, since they tend to demonstrate the absence of any moral wrongdoing on Mr Milne's part in relation to his present state of financial misfortune. In that regard, counsel for the Commissioner acknowledged that there was no suggestion of professional or social misbehaviour such as gambling or anything of that situation. Incidentally, the reference to 'chamber practice' was to an association (though not partnership) of lawyers where expenses are shared but not profits. 20 Further as to those circumstances concerning Mr Milne's financial position to which the Tribunal drew attention, it appears to have accepted at least implicitly the following factors in summary put forward and relied upon by Mr Milne: (i) Mr Milne's 'financial position was adversely affected by the fraud of a former partner' ; (ii) business catastrophes (inclusive of that fraud of his former partner in professional practice) had left Mr Milne with debts he could not manage, or at least substantially so; (iii) Mr Milne's financial position was further adversely affected by what the Tribunal described as 'poor financial performance of his next partnership venture and then by his chamber practice's expenses outweighing his ability to earn due to absences through ill health', each being further eventualities Mr Milne 'was unable to control' . 21 The Tribunal further pointed to the following factors as consequential to the circumstances which I have already recorded: (i) whether or not Mr Milne could be criticised 'for leaving the later partnership was not put to him in the context of foreseeing tax consequences' ; (ii) the inference was open to be drawn that Mr Milne 'took action to improve his circumstances as he derived less income from the partnership than the share taken into account for taxation purposes' ; (iii) Mr Milne's 'most recent efforts to remain in practice have been dogged by his continuing and serious health problems' ; (iv) Mr Milne's financial problems had 'largely come about through his attempts to remain afloat rather than excessive expenditure or lack of precaution' , yet he had 'taken steps to reduce his expenditures such as by removing his son from his former private school' .    As to factor (ii) above, it is of course the case that income and outgoings for fiscal purposes do not necessarily coincide with those incurred otherwise according to the general law. It could not be gainsaid that those factors which I have extracted above and in the preceding paragraph of these reasons were relevant to the issue concerning Mr Milne's hardship, the existence and extent whereof the Tribunal was required to resolve. 22 As to the factor of fairness to other taxpayers identified in Re Wilson , being a factor which I would acknowledge to be relevant to the Tribunal's approach in principle to decision-making, the Tribunal recorded also that Mr Milne had earned a high level of income in the past, and was 'still earning income in a higher bracket'. Moreover the Tribunal found that Mr Milne had been '... able to acquire assets and to live reasonably well throughout his adverse business fortunes' , though the notions of high and higher are of course relative concepts, and need to be applied with care having regard to all conceivably relevant circumstances. In any event the Tribunal accepted in favour of the Commissioner the proposition that '... releasing Mr Milne would not be fair in the absence of special factors' , consistently with the previous Tribunal decisions of Ferguson and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 779 and Spicer and Commissioner of Taxation [2002] AATA 960 , the Tribunal exemplifying Ferguson as a case involving insufficient hardship for the availability of taxation relief. In the present case moreover, the Tribunal emphasised as a so-called 'special factor' in favour of Mr Milne for the grant of serious hardship relief his 'battle to continue work despite his very poor health and the need to support his dependant son until he finishes his schooling and obtains his HSC' . 23 Further to the statutory notion of serious hardship addressed in decisions referrable to the not dissimilarly framed provisions of the precursor s 265 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth), reliance was placed by the Tribunal upon this Court's decisions in Powell v Evreniades (1989) 21 FCR 252, where Hill J made the following observations at 258-260 in the context of the then Tax Relief Board's statutory discretion to release the trustee of a deceased person's estate wholly or in part from a taxation liability in the case of 'serious hardship': '... The Court will not subject [a statement pursuant to s 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ] to a fine analysis with a view to finding through a microscopic study of it some error of law.... There is no definition in s 265 of what is meant by \\\"serious hardship\\\" nor would one expect there to be. Each of the words in the phrase is an ordinary English word having a well understood meaning... The context in which the words appear makes it clear that the Relief Board is to consider whether the exaction of the full amount of tax would involve the dependants of a deceased taxpayer in financial difficulty which in all the circumstances can be said to be serious... it is obvious enough that what will constitute either will depend upon the circumstances of a given case. It is inappropriate to endeavour in the abstract to state tests of what will and what will not constitute serious hardship within the context of s 265.    Clearly there would be severe financial hardship if the dependants of a deceased person were left destitute without any means of support. That is not to say that in any particular case something less than that will not constitute serious hardship. ... it was open to the Board to conclude that the exaction of the full amount of tax would cause serious hardship, just as it was also open to the Board to conclude that exaction of the whole tax would not leave this applicant and her daughter in a situation that could properly be described as one of serious hardship. The circumstances of the present case, while clearly very close to the end of the spectrum representing destitution still come within that range of spectrum in which the decision could not be described as unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense... that is to say unless consideration of some extraneous or irrelevant factor intervened to vitiate the decision.... ... I can see no error of law in the way to which the Board so proceeded. ' Understandably counsel for Mr Milne invoked, as largely here applicable, those observations of his Honour. As I have already implied, that precursor s 265 was expressed to require regard to be paid to the serious hardship which might otherwise affect a taxpayer in the event of an absence of intervention by way of release (or partial release) of income tax liability. That precursor provision operated directly in favour of the dependants of a deceased taxpayer as well as a taxpayer, but for present purposes, the dictum of his Honour in Powell nevertheless provides a significant measure of assistance in relation to the operation of the present s 340- 5 . 24 Further in his reasons for judgment in Powell at 263, Hill J referred to the dictum of Windeyer J in Giris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1969] HCA 5 ; (1969) 119 CLR 365 at 384 concerning the need '... to be guided and controlled by the policy and purpose of the enactment, so far as that is manifest in it [and to] exclude from... consideration any matter which it would be unlawful... to take as a criterion... [subject to the qualification where] the statute seems to allow great latitude to the Commissioner in forming his opinion' . Moreover his Honour referred to what was said by Dixon J (as he then was) in R v Trebilco; Ex parte FS Falkiner & Sons Ltd [1936] HCA 63 ; (1936) 56 CLR 20 at 32 as to certain statutory 'considerations by which an exercise of discretion is to be guided... [t] he nature of those considerations [to] be gathered from the scope and object of the provision' . Additionally his Honour referred further to dictum of Mason J (as he then was) in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40, where his Honour described the statutory discretion there addressed, albeit not related to fiscal exaction, as '... similarly unconfined, except in so far as there may be found in the subject matter, scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision-maker may legitimately have regard', and where his Honour thereafter proceeded to emphasise that '[b]y analogy, where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute, the court will not find that the    decision-maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act. ' Those factors have aspects of materiality in relation to the issue or issues here falling for consideration. 25 Subsequently in Van Grieken v Veilands (1991) 21 ATR 1639, Gummow J cited the principled approach outlined by Hill J in Powell with at least implicit approval, observing that his Honour had further pointed out (at 626 of Powell ) that the decision-maker was entitled to 'consider not only such matters as go to the issue of serious hardship, but also other matters which, in the discretion of the Board, may be relevant'. 26 Returning to the text of TR 2440, the Tribunal member (of course Deputy President Hunt) concluded that the notion of serious hardship appearing in subs 340-5(3) of the Administration Act, in the light of the illustrations therein given and the statutory policy otherwise at least implicitly evident, 'may mean less than extreme financial hardship but should be hardship of a significant kind in terms of normal community standards' , and that par 6 of that TR 2440 provided 'appropriate guidance as to the kind of matters which amount to serious hardship warranting a release from a tax debt' . The Tribunal member considered that 'Mr Milne's outgoings already exceed his income, according to the information he has provided, [and] he is at the worst level of financial hardship' , and moreover that 'should he lose his right to practise as a solicitor, not only he but his two children will suffer severe deprivation' , emphasising in that latter regard to education of children being 'one of the basic requirements set out in TR 2440' . The Tribunal member further observed that should Mr Milne be bankrupted, he and his children (two of which are apparently dependant on him financially or at least substantially so) would lose not only his income but the house where they all lived together. Each of those considerations were matters which the Tribunal was in my opinion entitled reasonably to take into account. 27 Nevertheless the Tribunal member acknowledged that 'even where there is serious hardship, other options should be considered before deciding that the discretion should be exercised in favour of the taxpayer' , and that '[o]ne option might be deferral or payment by instalments' , being an option which the Commissioner notified the Tribunal would be acceptable. Moreover the Commissioner pointed to patience on the Commissioner's part in relation to the collection of Mr Milne's taxation indebtedness when agreeing to the settlement in September 2002, and recorded that Mr Milne did not put any further offer of compromise after the rejection by the Commissioner of the offer made to Mr Milne in December 2003. The Tribunal recorded in that regard however that it was '... told... that this had involved his borrowing further in order to obtain a lump sum to contribute to his tax debt' , and that '[h] e had proposed to pay the remainder by instalments' , but that at the hearing the Commissioner 'did not suggest any level of appropriate payment by instalments and pressed the Tribunal to make a finding that Mr Milne had not demonstrated serious hardship' .    28 Under the heading Final Analysis , the Tribunal undertook a comprehensive summary of what it considered to be the critical circumstances placed before it. The care and precision with which that summary was articulated by the Tribunal warrant recitation of a number of aspects thereof below, rather than a summary merely as to their purport and effect. 29 The Tribunal hence further recorded that there were 'some deficiencies in expenses claimed by Mr Milne but I was left in no doubt as to the extent of Mr Milne's major expenses such as the mortgage payments necessarily made to prevent the mortgagor from foreclosing on the mortgage, thus putting the family out of their home' , and moreover that '[w]hile there were some deficiencies in Mr Milne's evidence and some expenses stated such as clothing and general household expenses that were on the generous side, I am satisfied that the information is as clear as Mr Milne is capable of giving the Tribunal in this situation' . The Tribunal further observed that 'the quantum of tax due under the judgment debt obtained by the Commissioner is continually subject to change' , but that the portion of the debt which was in focus before the Tribunal as a potentially releasable debt amounted to \\$149,876.68, as was apparently verified by the Commissioner, and further that Mr Milne had 'considerable non-releasable tax debts and continuing tax liabilities arising from his continuing earnings' , and that '[he] must make efforts to pay these debts as well as keep himself and his children in the necessities of life' . The Tribunal accepted Mr Milne's evidence, in my view significantly, that he had 'tried to arrange his affairs to the best of his ability under adversity' , and had 'behaved in a manner that is responsible and has not deliberately set out to ignore his tax obligations' . The Tribunal found yet further favourably to Mr Milne that his '... problems are beyond his control when taking into account his partnership problems and ill health as well as the departure of his spouse, thus removing another possible source of assistance' . 30 The Tribunal summarised its detailed considerations and findings to the effect that '... although bankruptcy does not normally constitute serious hardship, Mr Milne's case was different... because there are special circumstances in his case' , the same being summarised as follows in summary: (i) his age and serious health problems; (ii) the few remaining years left in his working life; (iii) the dependency of his two children; (iv) the likely loss of his practising certificate in the event of bankruptcy, and thus of the means of earning a living. Each of those factors need to be considered in the light of and subject to the qualification, upon which I have already made observations. 31 The senior Tribunal member pointed moreover to the reality of Mr Milne's diminishing prospects of being employed by 'someone else' , due to his age, ill health and the likely consequences thereof by way of periodic absences from work. The member pointed also to the implications of bankruptcy to Mr Milne's children, implicitly referring thereby to possible diminution in their opportunities for academic qualification with a view to future gainful engagement or employment. As the senior member I think rightly acknowledged, 'bankruptcy is not designed to be a punishment but a way out of hopeless debt with the chance of the debtor re-establishing after a time, usually three years' .    Moreover as was emphasised further by the senior member, in particular in the light of Mr Milne's age, the ensuing three years represented a period of time critical in terms of his ability to provide financial assistance to his family. 32 In the result, the Tribunal concluded that the circumstances which I have largely recorded constituted serious hardship within subs 340-5(3) of the Administration Act, and that therefore its discretion should be exercised to 'release Mr Milne from his taxation debt' . The Commissioner's contentions on the appeal 33 By way of threshold summary of the Commissioner's case on the appeal, the Commissioner contended that 'the facts as found by the Tribunal admitted of one conclusion only, namely, that [Mr Milne] would not suffer serious hardship within the meaning of s 340-5(3) of the Act', and that the Tribunal misinterpreted or misconstrued that legislative notion. Reliance was also placed by the Commissioner on TR 2440, in relation in particular to the statutory meaning of serious hardship . It remains important to bear in mind of course the juridical principles of statutory interpretation entrenched in the general law, as the Commissioner's Receivables Policy guidelines I have already extracted implicitly acknowledge. It will be recalled that TR 2440 emphasised the need for considering the notion of ' necessities according to normal community standards', including those of a basic kind inclusive of '... accommodation [and] education for children...' . 34 I was next referred by the Commissioner to the assistance to be gained from government statements of policy, as outlined by Brennan J (then a member of the Tribunal) in Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No 2) (1979) 2 ALD 634 at 640, and in particular the following: 'There are powerful considerations in favour of a Minister adopting a guiding policy. It can serve to focus attention on the purpose which the exercise of the discretion is calculated to achieve, and thereby to assist the Minister and others to see more clearly, in each case, the desirability of exercising the power in one way or another. Decision-making is facilitated by the guidance given by an adopted policy, and the integrity of decision-making in particular cases is the better assured if decisions can be tested against such a policy. By diminishing the importance of individual predilection, an adopted policy can diminish the inconsistencies which might otherwise appear in a series of decisions, and enhance the sense of satisfaction with the fairness and continuity of the administrative process. ' I draw attention in particular to his Honour's reference to 'the guidance given by an adopted policy' . Of course the operations of that policy in relation to contemporary values may be a matter of difficulty when it comes to making a judgment in particular cases. 35 Upon the footing of what was described as 'those guiding principles and rulings', the Commissioner contended that the Tribunal 'misapplied or misinterpreted the statute in relation to the facts proved', since the present was not a case, so it was emphasised, where Mr Milne's 'financial difficulty was such that either he or his dependants would be '... in significant need warranting action... to relieve their condition' (those words cited appearing at [24] of the Tribunal's decision).    The difficulty with that observation of generality lies in its application, and in particular in relation to Mr Milne's family exigencies as well as those of his own personally, involving as they do the need for reasonable accommodation for himself and apparently for two or at least the youngest of his three children, and completion of the education of that youngest child. 36 The Commissioner contended that in dealing with the issue of serious hardship , the Tribunal fell into error, in that the Tribunal: (i) failed to consider whether Mr Milne had sufficient equity in his assets to discharge all of his liabilities including the debt due to the Commissioner, without bankruptcy, and relied instead upon the statement of assets and liabilities provided by Mr Milne in September 2004, which however referred to his assets but not his liabilities; that material was said by the Commissioner to have demonstrated an excess of assets over liabilities of \\$409,800 and although Mr Milne subsequently provided an updated statement of assets and liabilities showing his financial position as of November 2004 (see in that regard what I have already reproduced in [8] above), nevertheless on the basis of that statement of assets and liabilities, there was available 'equity' in the sum of \\$199,200 to discharge a tax debt of \\$149,876.68; (ii) failed to take into account, adequately or at all, whether Mr Milne or his dependants would be deprived in reality of necessities according to normal community standards; in that regard it was said by the Commissioner that Mr Milne was in the position, at least for the foreseeable future, to earn significant income to provide for the necessities of life for one, or perhaps two, dependent children as well as himself; both the financial statement provided by Mr Milne to the Tribunal on 30 September 2004 and his updated financial information were further said to have demonstrated that just under one half of his estimated fortnightly expenses would be expended in mortgage payments; if the mortgage was to be discharged upon the sale of the properties at Eastwood and Brindabella, then on Mr Milne's own figures, there would be a fortnightly income surplus (even assuming the payment of a reasonable amount for rent on account of alternative accommodation, whatever that might be); and (iii) concentrated exclusively on what income Mr Milne required to survive on the assumption that he retained all of his assets, yet (according to the Commissioner) there were a number of errors inherent in that approach, in that: (a) if Mr Milne's level of expenditure remained approximately the same, and whether or not he was required to pay the amount due to the Commissioner, then absent the sale of his assets, he would face bankruptcy, yet relief of his income tax liability would not alleviate that plight, but would give preference to other creditors; (b) no or no proper regard was paid by the Tribunal to the extent of Mr Milne's assets generally; and (c) on Mr Milne's own case, some time within the next three years or so, he would cease to work; in such an event, he would have no income, and in order to discharge other creditors he would be required to sell his assets in any event. 37 In the formulation of those three heads of submissions, the Commissioner observed that although it was difficult to calculate Mr Milne's actual income, on the evidence of the four business activity statements filed by Mr Milne for the 2004 income tax year, his annual net income was in the order of \\$90,000. I observe that the Commissioner did not seemingly point to any calculations which the Commissioner might have undertaken as to Mr Milne's corresponding annual    outgoings, which were presumably substantial, if regard be paid to living expenses for himself and those of his youngest two children, as well as to repayment of interest bearing borrowings for which of course he was personally liable, albeit jointly and/or severally with his wife from whom he was separated. I would add the observation that maintenance of a financial capacity to service interest bearing borrowings is normally material to a borrower's preservation in his or her favour of the entire or substantially the entire value of a mortgaged security against what might otherwise eventuate by way of a 'forced sale' by a mortgagee exercising power of sale or otherwise by an insolvency trustee. 38 In elaboration upon those three heads of contentions, the Commissioner submitted further as follow: (i) Mr Milne held substantial assets, including a holiday house, and the evidence adduced before the Tribunal established that all of his liabilities could be met by the sale of those assets, notwithstanding that the holiday home was for the time being unsaleable; the Tribunal was said by the Commissioner in that context to have considered the question posed by subs 340-5(3) on the hypothesis that Mr Milne would be made bankrupt; thus at [24] of its reasons, the Tribunal stated that '(s)hould he be bankrupt...' and at [29] further stated that '(i)f he is made bankrupt...' ; those hypotheses were said to have been contrary to the statement made on behalf of the Commissioner to the Tribunal that the Commissioner would not pursue the then current bankruptcy proceedings after 18 June 2005; (ii) in any event, the fact that the Tribunal proceeded on that hypothesis indicated that it misunderstood what was meant by 'serious hardship' , at least partly because it assumed that the phrase referred only to revenue rather than revenue and capital; put another way, the Tribunal did not take proper account of the practical consequences of bankruptcy, in that the Tribunal did not understand, in order to determine whether there would be serious hardship, that all of the relevant circumstances, apart from those consequences, should be considered; (iii) the first of those errors was 'clear', in that although the Tribunal referred to the evidence regarding the value of Mr Milne's assets, it did not consider the same when determining whether there would be serious hardship ; instead (at [24]), it found that Mr Milne was, at the time of decision-making 'at the worst level of financial hardship' ; this finding was based on the fact that Mr Milne's outgoings exceeded his income, being outgoings which included mortgage repayments that on any view of the evidence would not be necessary to consider if the assets secured by the mortgage were to be sold; and (iv) the phrase serious hardship was used in the legislation in its ordinary English sense, and its context included the recovery or release of taxation liabilities in the immediate context of course of the Administration Act; that context was said to give the phrase a financial aspect, although such context was already inherent in the general concept of hardship, given the broad nature of that phraseology, and must encompass all of a given person's circumstances, including his or her capital assets as well as income, yet the Tribunal considered that the phrase only related to a person's income and his or her outgoings. 39 Moreover it was pointed out by the Commissioner that the value of a benefit received by a bankrupt fell within the operation of Subdivision D of Division 4B contained in Part VI of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Bankruptcy Act '), which was said to have two    elements: first it requires a bankrupt who derives income during the bankruptcy to pay contributions to his or her bankrupt's estate; secondly, it permits the bankrupt to seek to have contributions reduced in the case of hardship (in that regard I was referred to the circumstances considered by a Full Court (French, Cooper and Carr JJ) in Bond v The Trustee of the Property of Alan Bond, A Bankrupt (1994) 52 FCR 304 at 325, 327 and 332. 40 The implications of all that were said by the Commissioner to be as follows: (i) Division 4B of Part VI of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) came into force on 1 July 1992 by virtue of the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 (Cth), and the objects of Division 4B of Part VI appear in s 139J as follows: '(a) to require a bankrupt who derives income during the bankruptcy to pay contributions towards the bankrupt's estate; and (b) to enable the recovery of certain money and property for the benefit of the bankrupt's estate;' (ii) in general terms, that Division provides for the trustee to assess the amount of a bankrupt's income in each successive year of the bankruptcy, and may establish a liability on the part of the bankrupt, pursuant to an income tax assessment, to make a contribution out of an excess of income assessed over a specified threshold; (iii) the threshold amount is defined in terms of the maximum basic rate of pension payable under the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth); (iv) the liability of a bankrupt to pay a contribution pursuant to his or her trustee's assessment is imposed by s 139P(1) of the Bankruptcy Act , which provides: 'Subject to s 139Q , if the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive during a contribution assessment period as assessed by the trustee under an original assessment exceeds the actual income threshold amount applicable in relation to the bankrupt when that assessment is made, the bankrupt is liable to pay to the trustee a contribution in respect of that period. ' (v) section 139P(2) of the Bankruptcy Act provides for voluntary contributions where the assessed income falls below the threshold amount; s 139Q thereof imposes a liability to pay a contribution in respect of a contribution assessment period, where the trustee has made a subsequent assessment which exceeds the actual income threshold amount; (vi) the contribution payable by a bankrupt pursuant to that assessment process is defined in s 139S of the Bankruptcy Act as follows: 'The contribution that a bankrupt is liable to pay in respect of a contribution assessment period is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula: Assessed income- Actual income threshold amount 2 where: \\\"Assessed income\\\" means the amount assessed by the trustee to be the income that the bankrupt is likely to derive, or derived, during the contribution assessment period; \\\"Actual income threshold amount\\\" means the actual income threshold amount assessed by the trustee to be applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the assessment is made. '; (vii) the foregoing concept of 'actual income threshold amount' is further defined in s 139K on a sliding scale, increased according to the number of dependents that the bankrupt has and the extent of their dependency; 'the base income threshold amount' is defined in s 139K for a particular time as the amount that 'at that time, is specified in column 3, item 2, Table B, point 1064-B1, Pension Rate Calculator A, in the Social Security Act 1991 , multiplied by 3.5' ; (viii) in the present case, because Mr Milne has more than two dependents, the base income threshold amount is increased by 27%    (s 139K(c)); and (ix) once Mr Milne became bankrupt, he would be liable to contribute 50% of the difference between his actual income (as assessed by the trustee) and the base income threshold amount so increased by 27%; according to the Commissioner's calculations, upon the basis of an assessable annual income of \\$90,000.00 and two dependent children, the formula in s 139K of the Bankruptcy Act required an annual contribution of \\$29,958.56 or a fortnightly contribution of \\$1,152.25 (being less than half of Mr Milne's fortnightly mortgage payments). 41 Significantly therefore, so the Commissioner submitted, Division 4B of the Bankruptcy Act contains within it a mechanism to determine a higher income threshold in cases of hardship; pursuant to s 139T(1) of the Bankruptcy Act , where the trustee has made an assessment of a contribution that a bankrupt is liable to pay and that bankrupt considers that if required to make any such contribution, he or she would suffer hardship (emphasised by the Commissioner incidentally to be 'not serious hardship ') for any reason or reasons set out in subs 139T(2), then the bankrupt may apply to the trustee for the making of a determination. The reasons which might be operative in the favour of Mr Milne, if made bankrupt, were said to be found within sub-paragraphs (a)-(e) of s 139T(2) , which read as follows: '(a) the bankrupt or the dependent of a bankrupt suffers from an illness or disability that requires on-going medical attention and the supply of medicines, and the bankrupt is required to meet a substantial proportion of the costs of that medical attention or those medicines from his or her income. (b) the bankrupt is required to make payments from his or her income to meet the cost of child day care to enable the bankrupt to continue in employment or other work; (c) the bankrupt is living in rented accommodation that is not provided by, or by an authority of, the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or by a local government authority, and the bankrupt is required to pay the cost of that accommodation wholly or mainly from his or her income: (d) the bankrupt incurs substantial expense in travelling to and from the bankrupt's place of employment or other work, whether by public transport or otherwise; (e) the spouse of the bankrupt, or another person residing with the bankrupt, who ordinarily contributes to the cost of maintaining the bankrupt's household has become unable to contribute to those costs because of unemployment, illness or injury. ' 42 In summary, it was contended by the Commissioner that the Tribunal failed to consider all of the so-called 'true effects' which bankruptcy would have had on Mr Milne. Does any special rule apply in relation to a solicitor? 43 The foregoing heading was framed by the Commissioner for the purpose of further submissions in support of the present appeal. At the level of generality, the Commissioner asserted that bankruptcy did not mean that a solicitor must lose his or her right to practice. Pursuant to s 65 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) ('the LP Act'), bankruptcy and acts of bankruptcy give rise to a show cause event which is to be investigated by the Council of the Law Society of New South Wales. Section 68(1) of the LP Act further provides as follows: 'On becoming aware of the happening of a show cause event in relation to an applicant or holder, the appropriate    Council must investigate and determine within the required period whether the applicant or holder is a fit and proper person to hold a local practising certificate. ' The Council of the Law Society of New South Wales was said by the Commissioner to have issued guidelines operative from 1 July 1997 which made clear that the fact of bankruptcy should not extinguish a person's right to practice; those guidelines, which were tendered in evidence, include the following: '3. Mode of practice 3.1 In the opinion of the Law Society, the fact of bankruptcy should not extinguish a person's right to a livelihood. 3.2 It is considered that solicitors, although bankrupt, should be entitled to practise on their own account, in partnership, or as employees on the condition that, while bankrupt, they will not nor attempt to: • operate any trust account or controlled money account or receive any money from any other person in circumstances to which s 61 of the [Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW)] applies; • commence or continue to act as a trustee of any real or personal property; • accept appointment to, or continue to act in the office of executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate, or as trustee of any real or personal property, or as donee under any power of attorney or other instrument under whose authority a power of appointment or disposition of property can be exercised; nor • engage in any activity from which a bankrupt is disqualified under any Federal or New South Wales law. ' Of course an exercise by a solicitor of that right to practice needs to be considered in the particular context of a sole practitioner such as Mr Milne, with the attendant likely incidents of any such continuation of practice. 44 The test to be applied when determining fitness to hold a practising certificate, in the context of course of bankruptcy, was said by the Commissioner to be 'robust', the question not being whether the indebtedness which led to the bankruptcy was brought about by or associated with dishonest conduct by the applicant for a certificate, but whether the circumstances in which the act of bankruptcy was committed were such as to persuade the Council that at the time of its determination, the person is not a fit and proper person to hold a practising certificate (I was referred in that context generally to New South Wales Bar Association v Murphy [2002] NSWCA 138 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 23). There was no material adduced in evidence indicative of any shortcoming in Mr Milne's fitness and propriety to practice as a lawyer. 45 The Commissioner submitted moreover that the Tribunal failed to consider and take into account the provisions relevantly of the LP Act. It was asserted in that regard that on a proper understanding of the meaning of serious hardship , a person such as Mr Milne, who had the capacity to meet his tax liability out of currently held assets, could never satisfy the Commissioner that his circumstances gave rise to the exercise of any discretion in favour of release from tax liability. For that reason alone, it was said by the Commissioner that the Tribunal's decision ought to be set aside, there being no utility in ordering that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal for proper or further consideration. Bearing in mind that the realty here involved in both instances was held jointly with his estranged wife, it would be a formidable exercise to determine what funds, if any, might    ultimately be available for payment of the subject outstanding income taxes, and for the satisfaction of the secured creditors of Mr Milne and his wife to the extent of any shortfall on any mortgagee sale, and of her half share in the 'equity' of any remaining net proceeds in relation to the sale of their jointly held realty. Further contentions of the Commissioner 46 The Tribunal's finding as to likely 'serious hardship' was broadly contended by the Commissioner to be based on an hypothesis that caused the Tribunal to ignore matters that were relevant to the task required of it by s 340-5 of the Administration Act, those matters being the operation of the Bankruptcy Act , and also of the LP Act. The context, scope and object of s 340-5 of the Administration Act was said by the Commissioner to have required the Tribunal to consider the matters that would, or could, affect the financial circumstances of Mr Milne in the light of his then current tax liability. Accordingly, so the Commissioner's submissions continued, for the Tribunal to fail to take into consideration matters, such as the operation relevantly of those statutory provisions, constituted a further error of law, either by way of statutory misconstruction, or failure to take into account relevant considerations due to statutory misconstruction or otherwise. In that latter regard, I was referred to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24, in particular in relation to what appears in the reasons for judgment of Mason J (as he then was) at 39, under the heading Failure To Take Into Account a Relevant Consideration . Of course in circumstances where the Tribunal, at least inherently or implicitly in the particular context the subject necessarily of consideration by the decision-maker, took into account relevant considerations and correspondingly took no account of irrelevant considerations, so much would normally suffice to satisfy the requirements of administrative obligations. 47 The power under s 340-5(3) was contended by the Commissioner in any event to require two matters in particular to be considered and determined: first, whether there would be serious hardship to Mr Milne in the circumstances postulated , and secondly, whether in all the circumstances otherwise prevailing, the Commissioner ought to have exercised the statutory discretion to release Mr Milne's subject taxation liability. In considering the first of those issues, it was contended by the Commissioner that the Tribunal addressed what it considered to be the so-called test of foreseeability and control, presumably thereby referring to the circumstances in which Mr Milne came to have incurred the subject tax liabilities in the first place. The second consideration was described in terms as to whether the release of Mr Milne, if granted, would be fair to 'others', whatever the implications of that broad description. The Tribunal was said by the Commissioner to have considered that in circumstances where a person had earnt a high level of income in the past, and was continuing to earn a high income, special factors were necessary in order to establish 'serious hardship'. The description 'high income' is in any event somewhat unspecific to be necessarily helpful.    The Tribunal found that Mr Milne's 'battle to continue his professional work' , despite ill-health, and his need to support his dependent son until he finished school, were 'special factors' . 48 The approaches of the Tribunal's reasoning leading to its decision-making were attacked by the Commissioner as wrong, in that it was said to have 'misunderstood the meaning of serious hardship as a so-called backward looking matter, rather than a matter that turned on an objective analysis of the future'. On a proper understanding of that statutory term, questions as to special factors were said not to arise. In particular, the Commissioner asserted that a taxpayer's 'struggle to continue working' was simply irrelevant, but for what it may ultimately matter, I do not think that somewhat simplistic description sufficiently reflects the complexity of circumstances that the Tribunal explicitly and implicitly took into account in relation to Mr Milne. 49 Addressing a further basis advanced by the Commissioner for the present administrative review sought, it was contended that on a proper understanding of the two-tiered test in subs 340-5(3) of the Administration Act, no reasonable Tribunal could have exercised the statutory discretion to release Mr Milne from his taxation liability. Reference was made by the Commissioner in that regard to the grant of administrative relief made available in Parramatta City Council v Pestell [1972] HCA 59 ; (1972) 128 CLR 305, which related to a local Council's imposition of a rate because of the special benefit flowing from the Council's execution of a particular work or service on public property, and which the High Court affirmed to be invalid. It was argued by the Commissioner conversely that the factual circumstances of a high income earner having substantial assets, sufficient in value to meet all current liabilities, could not reasonably fall within the statutory notion of serious hardship . It is normally a formidable task to establish that the decision of an administrative decision-maker satisfies that test of invalidity. The Commissioner advanced the further case that the exercise of the Tribunal's power to release Mr Milne was unreasonable, in that on the evidence placed before it, no reasonable person could have come to the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in its decision the subject of appeal. I was referred again to Peko-Wallsend where at 41, Mason J discussed the scope of the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness. I would make a similar observation upon that submission to that which I have made in relation to satisfaction of the test in Pestell . 50 In the context of the foregoing principles concerning administrative relief and avenues to administrative relief invoked by the Commissioner, it was thus contended that the existence of sufficient evidence had been placed before the Tribunal as to the following matters relevantly affecting the financial circumstances of Mr Milne: (i) he had an excess of assets over liabilities; (ii) upon any sale of his assets, he would have had sufficient funds to discharge all his debts, including the tax liability for which release was obtained; (iii) upon the sale of his assets, Mr Milne's income would have been likely to exceed his outgoings; (iv) Mr Milne's assets included cash in the sum of \\$47,000; (v) if Mr Milne was to be made bankrupt, the trustee in bankruptcy would be likely to    sell all of his assets; (vi) at the end of three years, Mr Milne would be required to sell any remaining assets to discharge his outstanding liabilities in any event; and (vii) the Tribunal had power to order a partial release of the tax liability otherwise eligible for release. 51 It was contended by the Commissioner that the Tribunal did not take any of those matters into consideration when exercising its statutory jurisdiction to the extent complained of, and accordingly it did not properly exercise the powers the subject thereof. The Commissioner contended further as to an error in law on the part of the Tribunal by way of taking into account irrelevant considerations in the exercise of its powers and authority, being considerations which I have already recorded and need not reiterate. In summary, the Commissioner submitted that the Tribunal's decision complained of was vitiated by the numerous errors of law, cumulatively or in the alternative, to which I have referred, and should be set aside. Conclusions 52 The circumstances in which Mr Milne was placed at the time of the conclusion of the hearing of the evidence by the Tribunal on 9 May 2005 may have since undergone material change, so such being often an incident to administrative review which is the subject of subsequent appeal, in particular where the circumstances prevailing at the time of decision-making have continued to evolve. I must of course resolve the issues of law here arising by reference to the evidence placed before the decision-maker. The Tribunal reached the conclusion of course in favour of Mr Milne of serious hardship within the scope of operation of that subs 340-5(3) expression. The issue arising for the Court's consideration on the appeal is whether that conclusion should be vitiated upon the basis of an application by the Tribunal of what the Commissioner contends to have been the wrong statutory test. The circumstances relevantly of Mr Milne's professional, business and domestic affairs at the material times were not without complication, involving as they did substantially hypothecated real estate assets held in the joint ownership of himself and his wife who had by then separated in terms of their marital relationship, and a serious threat to Mr Milne's capacity to continue to earn professional income as a specialist family law solicitor by reason of his serious ill-health. Such personalty as he owned was of relatively insignificant value, at least when compared to the jointly held realty which was however heavily hypothecated. That realty to the extent comprising the jointly owned former matrimonial home continues to be occupied by Mr Milne and the two late teenage dependant children of the marriage, or presently at least the youngest child, the evidence being perhaps somewhat unclear in that regard. The other jointly owned realty of Mr and Mrs Milne (located at Brindabella in country New South Wales), for reasons I have briefly mentioned, was at the time of the Tribunal decision-making unsaleable. 53 It was reasonably open to the Tribunal, on the basis of the complexity of the evidence placed before it, to arrive at the determination which it did as to the subjection of Mr    Milne to a condition of serious hardship within the scope of operation of subs 340-5(3) of the Administration Act, in the absence of the release or waiver by the Commissioner of Mr Milne's fiscal indebtedness the subject of the proceedings, at least to a substantial or significant extent. I have reached therefore the conclusion that the present application of the Commissioner for administrative review of the Tribunal's decision-making has not been established upon any viable juridical basis, and that the same must therefore be dismissed. That conclusion accommodates in my opinion relevant principles of administrative law which are in line with the authorities. 54 In reaching that conclusion, I have been unable to accept that the Tribunal was bound to adopt and implement the approach to administrative review advocated by the Commissioner, inclusively by way of appraisal of any comparison of the value of Mr Milne's assets with the amount of his liabilities at any relevant point of time, having regard to the reality of the extent of the financial hardship which would be likely to attend an exaction of the amount required to satisfy Mr Milne's outstanding taxation indebtedness, inclusive of accrued statutory interest changes, which, if not leaving Mr Milne 'destitute without any means of support' , would have constituted nevertheless serious hardship , in accordance with the text of the Commissioner's policy guidelines framed by TR 2440 and in the light of the approach undertaken specifically and by way of practical exemplification in Re Filsell and Re Wilson . 55 In reaching that conclusion, there is sufficient evidence, to the extent postulated by the Tribunal, as to Mr Milne's adoption of a perceived parental obligation to financially support his dependent son until he obtained his higher school certificate, the expression need taking its context from Mr Milne's personal and otherwise domestic circumstances established by the Tribunal, as well as from his professional circumstances as a sole legal practitioner specialising in family law. It may be reasonably inferred that Mr Milne prospered financially in his earlier professional years as a successful lawyer in the sphere of that specialty, but it was reasonably open to the Tribunal nevertheless to have anchored its decision-making largely upon his circumstances of misfortune sustained in more recent times, and in particular by reason of his former legal practitioner partner's misappropriation of funds, and of his own deteriorating health involving both severe illnesses and physical disabilities. Those circumstances need of course to be balanced, as the Tribunal's reasoning has exemplified, with the factors which the Commissioner's submissions have sought to distil, and which I have sought to summarise in these reasons. It may be readily acknowledged moreover, as the Commissioner emphasised, that there is no special rule in relation to the ongoing entitlement of a solicitor to continue the practice of his profession notwithstanding bankruptcy, though the reality of so doing effectively and to maximum advantage, especially in the context of a sole practitioner (as of course in the case of Mr Milne), is a matter of some practical significance to the requisite extent of the careful consideration accorded by the Tribunal's reasons for decision.    56 In my opinion submissions propounded by the Commissioner, which I have sought to outline in detail discretely or in the aggregate, do not vitiate the conclusions of the Tribunal according to law. The Tribunal's conclusions were reasonably open for adoption, being sufficiently founded upon evidentiary material bearing upon the critical statutory issue of serious hardship , including in particular the fraudulent conduct of Mr Milne's former partner in legal practice and its adverse effect upon Mr Milne financially and probably to at least an intangible extent professionally, and the unsaleable character of the Brindabella property for the time being for the reasons I have earlier indicated. It is of course necessary in that regard that the Commissioner's challenge to the factual findings of the Tribunal should establish a viable footing according to principles of administrative law, and the present appeal does not of course operate by way of a re- hearing. As I have foreshadowed, I am unable to accept that the Commissioner has distilled administrative error in the juridical sense referrable to the reasoning and findings of the Tribunal, being reasoning and findings which were rationally open for adoption in my opinion according to principles of administrative law, and in particular in the light of the relevant evidentiary material placed before the Tribunal. That material was consistent essentially with the conclusion that any enforced exaction of the outstanding income tax indebtedness of Mr Milne would cause serious hardship within the scope of that notion established for instance in Powell and subsequently in Van Grieken , and as continues in operation in the terms of operation of s 340-5 of the Administration Act. 57 I am accordingly of the opinion that the Commissioner has not exposed a viable factor of relevance which the Tribunal omitted to take into account, or of irrelevance which it did take into account, in either case such as to have vitiated according to administrative law the conclusion which the Tribunal reached in what was indeed a complexity of circumstances. 58 The appeal should therefore be dismissed.

The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant. 2 The appellants are a husband and wife and are citizens of India. They claim a well-founded fear of persecution in that country of their origin by reason of the appellant husband's political association and activity with the Congress Party in Gujarat. The appellant husband claimed in his statement to the delegate that he strongly condemned the Godhra train tragedy in February 2002, and because of his activities in helping victims and arranging rallies to have the culprits of that incident arrested and punished, he became the target of extremists from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), who burnt his office, destroyed his business and made threatening phone calls demanding that he leave the Congress Party. The appellant husband claimed that he reported those threats to the police, but that no action was taken. The appellant husband also claimed that as a result of his association with the leading candidate for the Congress Party, he was beaten by the same extremists so severely that his arm was broken and he was hospitalised. 3 The Tribunal found that the appellants claims lacked the necessary detail to establish relevant facts sufficient to establish refugee status, and in particular that it was not satisfied that the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution. The Tribunal accepted that the appellants lived in the epicentre of the violence which occurred in Gujarat, but that the arson of the husband's business was more plausibly explicable as an aspect of the general violence and pattern of destruction. The Tribunal cited independent country information as a demonstration of the fact that perpetrators of the violence directed the same towards Muslim people, whereas the appellants are Hindu, and accordingly their claim that the police would not assist them was not credible, as well as was unsupportable to the extent of its alleged detail. The Tribunal also found that it was unlikely that the appellants were targeted because of criticism of Gujarat's Chief Minister, since the male appellant in particular was but one of many critics of the BJP and RSS. The appellants also failed to provide details explaining why they were targeted. Although the appellant's claimed that relocation was not possible the Tribunal notified the appellants in any event that it was not able to make a decision in their favour based    on the information placed before the delegate, and invited the appellants to attend the hearing and address their claims orally to the Tribunal Member. However it was said that the appellants wrote to the Tribunal declining that offer and asked for a determination in their absence. 4 The appellants asserted in their further amended application filed on 20 January 2005 that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration when it assessed whether the delegate of the Minister raised reasonable grounds for not granting a protection visa, and that the Tribunal failed in that regard to consider properly the chance of persecution if they were returned to India. The appellants advanced the following details in support of those assertions: first that the appellant husband was persecuted by Muslims because of his political popularity; secondly that the appellants were unable to collect documentary evidence; thirdly that the Tribunal did not provide the appellants with adequate particulars of the independent country information; fourthly that the Tribunal did not provide the appellants with adequate opportunity to respond to the substance of this information; fifthly that the information used by the Tribunal did not show that Congress politicians are safe; sixthly that the appellants did not get an opportunity to attend the Tribunal hearing because they were not informed of the consequences of non-attendance or the hearing procedure; seventhly that the appellants needed an opportunity to give oral evidence and the decision of the Tribunal was affected by a lack of procedural fairness; and eighthly, that since the appellants had been persecuted by the BJP, it would not be possible for them to relocate in India. 5 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal's decision was unaffected by jurisdictional error and therefore dismissed the application with costs. The Federal Magistrate further found that the Tribunal had not been satisfied that the appellants had a well founded fear of persecution because of the absence of evidence to support their claims. The appellants admitted that they could not provide evidence by then not forthcoming, and did not attend the hearing as a consequence of bad advice. Moreover the independent country information was said by Barnes FM to fall within the exception under s 424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'), and did not require notification of the Tribunal's citation thereof. The reasoning of the Tribunal concerning the lack of detail in the appellants application and their failure to attend the hearing, were said to be matters of evaluative reasoning, inclusive of their thought processes, which were not required to be brought to the attention of the appellants. Barnes FM further found that the ground for review challenging the independent country information used to demonstrate that members of the appellant husband's political party were safe was misconceived, since the Tribunal had found that the appellants had not provided enough evidence to establish that the appellant husband was in fact targeted, and had rejected the notion that relocation was not an alternative open to the appellants. Moreover Barnes FM explained that the Tribunal did consider the consequences of relocation in India, and found that so much would be possible having regard to the    material placed before it to the effect that the appellant husband held business interests in four States of India and the BJP was not a dominant political party in other States. The Federal Magistrate further held that the Tribunal's decision did not lack rational and logical reasoning and did not contravene the Act because the appellants made the choice not to give further evidence, and consequently the Tribunal was entitled to proceed on that footing. 6 The notice of appeal raised the following grounds: first, that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision; secondly that the Tribunal failed to 'assess the harm from the perspective of the persecutor' when considering the question of well-founded fear; thirdly that the Tribunal did not properly consider the basis of fear of persecution and ignored the appellant husband's evidence concerning his political activities; fourthly that the 'Tribunal adopted a harsh approach' and failed to give 'importance to the real issues' relevant to the case as to denial of procedural fairness in favour of the appellant. In relation to that final ground, the notice of appeal stated that the appellant husband informed the Federal Magistrate why the appellants did not attend the hearing, but the Federal Magistrate did not believe his testimony that he had relied for assistance and advice on his migration agent who did not however make him aware of the consequences of non-attendance at the Tribunal. 7 At the hearing of the appeal in this Court, the appellant was unable to demonstrate, nor did he seek to demonstrate, error in any of the Tribunal's reasoning, but instead sought an adjournment to enable he and his wife to obtain evidentiary material from India in refutation of the Tribunal's findings. He did not detail explicitly what that evidence might be, or its particular source, and in any event in the light of the Minister's understandable opposition to any adjournment for that purpose, I rejected that request at the instance of the Minister's solicitor. Plainly the appellants having first arrived in Australia on 21 February 2003, the Minister's opposition could not be described as unjustifiable, particularly since nothing specific of potential significance was indicated as likely to be forthcoming. 8 Accordingly I ordered that the appeal be dismissed.

The hearing of QUD 389/2005 is currently scheduled to commence in Mt Isa on Monday 28 August 2006. 2 The respondent opposes the notice of motion. 3 As a general rule Courts are reluctant to vacate trial dates for a number of reasons, including that the parties are entitled to rely on trial dates which have been set, and that serious inconvenience to the parties, the Courts, and other litigants can arise because of the need to identify later trial dates. However, the justice of the case is the paramount concern in considering this issue. As was pointed out by Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in The State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146 at 154: 'Case management is not an end in itself. It is an important and useful aid for ensuring the prompt and efficient disposal of litigation. But it ought always to be borne in mind, even in changing times, that the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice and no principle of case management can be allowed to supplant that aim. ' 4 The applicants in this case have submitted that the case of Baird & Ors v State of Queensland (No 377 of 2005), which is currently on appeal to the Full Federal Court, is an application involving an almost identical application to the present except that it involved Aboriginal persons who had worked at the Hope Vale and Wujal Wujal reserves between 1975 and 1986. The applicants also submit that a comparison of the applications and the statements of claim in the two cases clearly illustrates this. 5 In both Baird and this case before me, the primary proceedings involve an application pursuant to s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) for compensation for loss and damage suffered by the applicants as a result of the respondent breaching the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). 6 Clear possible alternatives are that the hearing proceed, but judgment in this matter be reserved until the Baird appeal decision has been delivered, and/or the parties be given leave to make additional submissions after the hearing and in light of principles which may emerge from the Baird appeal. As the respondent has submitted, many of the applicants and the witnesses are elderly, and postponing the hearing of the matter will potentially exacerbate an issue of availability of witnesses which has already arisen.    However in this case the applicants have submitted that: • awaiting the appeal decision in Baird could result in the settlement of the present proceedings because it could clarify the application of the law relating to the events in question • awaiting the appeal decision in Baird could result in reduced hearing days in the present proceedings because it could narrow the issues in dispute • if the proceedings are not adjourned, it is possible that the proceeding will have to be reopened after the appeal decision in Baird , or, alternatively, there may be an appeal in the present proceedings which would have been avoided if the present proceedings awaited the appeal decision in Baird . 7 In my view it is appropriate that the trial date be vacated. I am persuaded that it would be in the interests of justice to do so. In my view, proceeding in late August in light of the aforementioned possibilities canvassed by the applicants could cause additional and unnecessary expense and inconvenience to the parties, the witnesses and the Court that would outweigh the inconvenience of rescheduling the trial date in these circumstances. Further, I am conscious that many of the applicants and witnesses are elderly, and requiring them to attend a hearing to give evidence, when, as postulated by the applicants, the matter may actually not proceed depending on the outcome of Baird , is an issue which in my view it is appropriate to take into account in deciding whether adjournment of this matter is appropriate. 8 Accordingly, I order that the hearing be adjourned to a date to be fixed and costs be reserved.

The Plaintiff, Regional Publishers Pty Limited ('Regional'), desires to acquire those preference shares compulsorily, pursuant to the provisions of Part 6A.2 of Chapter 6A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Act'). Regional is able to do so, so long as it satisfies the prerequisites of Part 6A.2 and, in the events that have happened, it establishes that the terms on which it proposes to acquire the preference shares give a fair value for them. Dr Elkington and Gepps say that Regional has not satisfied the prerequisites of Part 6A.2 and that, in any event, the terms upon which Regional proposes to acquire their preference shares does not give them a fair value for the preference shares. COMPULSORY ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE ACT 2 Division 1 of Part 6A.2 of the Act deals with the compulsory acquisition of securities by a 90% holder , as that term is defined in the Act. Section 664A(2), which is in Division 1, provides that a person is a 90% holder in relation to a class of shares of a company if: • the person's voting power in the Company is at least 90 per cent, and • the person holds full beneficial interests in at least 90% by value of all shares of the Company. Section 664A(3) provides that a 90% holder in relation to a class of shares of a company may compulsorily acquire all of the shares in that class in which the person does not have full beneficial interests if, relevantly, the Court approves the acquisition under s 664F. Section 664F is activated where people who hold shares object to the proposed acquisition. However, the procedure contemplated by Division 1 must be followed before any application is made to the Court for approval under s 664F. 3 Under s 664AA, the 90% holder in relation to a class of shares may compulsorily acquire shares in that class only if the holder lodges a compulsory acquisition notice for the acquisition with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('the Commission'), within the period of six months after the 90% holder becomes a 90% holder. Under s 664C(1) the 90% holder must prepare a notice that sets out a cash sum for which the 90% holder proposes to acquire the shares and provides certain other information specified in that provision. Under s 664C(2), the 90% holder must then: • lodge the notice with the Commission; • give each person who is a holder of shares in the class the notice, a copy of an expert's report under s 667A and an objection form; and • give the Company copies of those documents. 4 Part 6A.4 of the Act is concerned with expert's reports and valuations.    Under s 667A(1), an expert's report under s 664C must: • be prepared by a person nominated by the Commission under s 667AA, • state whether, in the expert's opinion, the terms proposed in the notice give a fair value for the shares concerned, and • set out the reasons for forming that opinion. Under s 667A(2), the expert's report must also state whether, in the expert's opinion, the person has full beneficial ownership in at least 90% by value of all the shares of the Company and must set out the reasons for forming that opinion. 5 Under s 667AA, a person who proposes to obtain an expert's report for the purposes of s 664C must request the Commission to nominate a person to prepare the expert's report. The Commission must nominate an appropriate person to prepare the report. In determining whether a person is an appropriate person to prepare an expert's report, the Commission must consider the nature of the company to be valued. 6 Under s 667C(1), to determine what is fair value for shares for the purposes of Chapter 6A, the following steps must be taken: • first, assess the value of the relevant company as a whole , • then allocate that value among the classes of issued shares in the company, taking into account the relative financial risk, and voting and distribution rights, of the classes, and • then allocate the value of each class pro rata among the shares in that class, without allowing a premium or applying a discount for particular shares in that class. Under s 667C(2), in determining what is fair value for shares, for the purposes of Chapter 6A, the consideration, if any, paid for shares in that class within the previous six months must also be taken into account. 7 Section 664E(1) provides that a person who holds shares covered by a compulsory acquisition notice may object to the acquisition of the shares by signing an objection form and returning it to the 90% holder. The 90% holder must lodge with the Commission a copy of any objection forms returned under that provision. If people who hold at least 10 per cent of the shares covered by the compulsory acquisition notice object to the acquisition within a specified period, the 90% holder must give everyone to whom the compulsory acquisition notice was sent, relevantly, a notice that the 90% holder has applied to the Court for approval of the acquisition under s 664F. 8 Under s 664F(1), if people who hold at least 10 per cent of the shares covered by a compulsory acquisition notice object to the acquisition within a specified period, the 90% holder may apply to the Court for approval of the acquisition of the shares covered by the notice. Under s 664F(3), if the 90% holder establishes that the terms set out in the compulsory acquisition notice give a fair value for the shares, the Court must approve the acquisition of the shares on those terms. Otherwise the Court must confirm that the acquisition will not take place. Section 664F(4) provides that the 90% holder must bear the costs that a person incurs on legal proceedings in relation to such an application, unless the Court is satisfied that the person acted improperly, vexatiously or otherwise unreasonably.    PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF PREFERENCE SHARES BY REGIONAL 9 Regional became a 90% holder in relation to fully paid ordinary shares and preference shares of the Company on 29 September 2005. By letter of 18 October 2005, Regional's solicitors, Deacons, requested the Commission to nominate a person for the purpose of preparing an expert's report under s 667AA of the Act. By letter of 2 November 2005, the Commission nominated three companies pursuant to the request made by Deacons. One of the companies named in the letter was described as follows: ' Licence holder: Ernst & Young Advisory Services Ltd '. The letter of 2 November 2005 stated that one of the three companies named could be chosen to prepare the necessary report. The letter also referred to the provisions of the Act whereby an appeal lay to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from the Commission's decision nominating those three companies. 10 For the purpose of nominating independent experts under s 667AA, the Commission maintains two registers of experts. One is a register of experts who are able to prepare reports for large companies, being companies with a consolidated gross operating revenue of more then \\$10 million or consolidated gross assets of more than \\$5 million. The second is a register of experts who are able to prepare reports for companies that meet neither of those criteria. The Commission appoints to the registers only experts with a licence under s 913B of the Act that authorises a person who carries on a financial services business to provide financial services ('Australian financial services licence'). 11 As at 2 November 2005, the registers maintained by the Commission included the name ' Ernst & Young Advisory Services Ltd '. There is no company with that name. However, there is a company with the name ' Ernst & Young Transaction Advisory Services Ltd ' ('Ernst & Young'). Ernst & Young is the holder of Australian financial services licence No. 240585. The Commission intended to appoint Ernst & Young to the registers maintained by it. And it is clear that the registers contained an error in relation to the name of Ernst & Young. That error resulted in the Commission, in its letter of 2 November 2005, nominating ' Ernst & Young Advisory Services Ltd ' rather than Ernst & Young. 12 Ernst & Young wrote to Regional on 9 January 2006, setting out the proposed terms of its engagement by Regional to prepare an independent expert's report in relation to the proposed compulsory acquisition of preference shares in the Company. On 28 February 2006, Regional acknowledged that that letter and its attachments formed a binding agreement between Ernst & Young and Regional.    13 Pursuant to that engagement, Ernst & Young provided to Regional a report prepared by it, dated 20 March 2006 ('the E&Y Report'). In the E&Y Report, Ernst & Young expressed the following opinions: • The consideration to be paid by Regional under the proposed offer to holders of preference shares in the Company, of \\$2.50 per share, is greater than Ernst & Young's assessed fair market value of the preference shares. • Regional has full beneficial ownership in at least 90 per cent by value of all the shares of the Company. The E&Y Report was signed by Mr Stuart G. Bright and Mr John E. Gibson, each of whom is a director of Ernst & Young and a representative of Ernst & Young for the purposes of Part 7.6 of the Act. Ernst & Young's reasons for their opinions were set out in a detailed attachment to the E&Y Report. 14 On 20 March 2006, Regional lodged with the Commission a compulsory acquisition notice in respect of preference shares in the Company and dispatched to each holder of preference shares a compulsory acquisition notice, a copy of the E&Y Report and an objection form. It also gave the Company copies of those documents. The compulsory acquisition notice provided, relevantly, as follows: ' [Regional] hereby gives notice that it proposes to compulsorily acquire preference shares that you hold for the cash amount of \\$2.50 for each preference share. ... During the last twelve months [Regional] has purchased securities of the same class for \\$2.00 per preference shares and \\$2.50 per preference share. ' 15 Thereafter, people who hold at least 10 per cent of the preference shares objected within the relevant period to the acquisition of their shares by Regional. Accordingly, on 19 May 2006, Regional applied to the Court pursuant to s 664F of the Act for approval of the acquisition of the preference shares covered by the compulsory acquisition notice. Dr Elkington and Gepps have appeared in the proceeding and have been joined as defendants. Another holder of preference shares has made a written submission through Regional, but has not appeared. THE ISSUES 16 The question that arises under s 664F is whether Regional has established that the terms set out in the compulsory acquisition notice, of payment of \\$2.50 in cash per preference share, gives a fair value for the preference shares. However, several specific issues have been raised by Dr Elkington and Gepps. The first issues concern the nomination of Ernst & Young by the Commission. First, they say that Ernst & Young was not nominated and that a non-existent company was nominated. Secondly, they say that Part 6A.4 only permits the nomination of an individual as an appropriate person to prepare a report and does not permit the nomination of a company.    17 In addition, the defendants have raised an issue concerning the content of the E&Y Report. They say that the E&Y Report does not satisfy the requirements of s 667C in determining what is fair value for the preference shares. However, each eschews a contention that any failure to comply strictly with s 667C invalidated the process that led to Regional's application to the Court. Rather, they say that the evidence before the Court, insofar as it is limited to the E&Y Report, falls short of establishing that the terms set out in the compulsory acquisition notice gives a fair value for the preference shares. Specifically, they point to what they say is a special value arising from the benefits that accrue to the Company by becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Regional: they complain about the allocation of the value of those benefits between the ordinary shares and the preference shares of the Company. 18 It is convenient to deal first with the Commission's nomination of Ernst & Young and then with the valuation questions. NOMINATION OF ERNST & YOUNG Misnomer 19 There can be no doubt that the Commission intended to appoint Ernst & Young to the registers maintained by it for the purposes of s 667A. There is no company with the name Ernst & Young Advisory Services Ltd. Notwithstanding the reference to a company with that name in the Commission nomination of 2 November 2005, I consider that the letter should be construed as referring to Ernst & Young. In any event, the misnomer is no more than a procedural irregularity and a nomination by the Commission pursuant to s 667AA(2) is a proceeding under the Act. Regional calls in aid s 1322 of the Act, which deals with relief from the consequence of irregularities. Under s 1322(1), a proceeding under the Act is not invalidated because of any procedural irregularity unless the Court is of the opinion that the irregularity has caused or may cause substantial injustice that cannot be remedied by an appropriate order of the Court. Clearly the misnomer has caused no injustice. The nomination of 2 November 2005 was not invalid by reason of the misnomer of Ernst & Young. A Company is a Person 20 Section 667AA(2) provides that a person who proposes to obtain an expert's report for the purposes of s 664C must request the Commission to nominate a person to prepare the expert's report. Clearly, the word ' person ' first appearing includes a corporation. That is to say, s 664A clearly contemplates that a corporation may be a 90% holder in relation to a class of shares. It would be curious, therefore, if the word ' person ' when used in the same sentence had a different meaning, such that it is limited to a natural person. 21 Section 22(1)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) provides that the word ' person ', when used in a statute, includes a corporation unless the contrary intention appears.    Further, s 23(a) of that Act provides that words importing gender include every other gender. The question is whether a contrary intention appears from the context in which the word 'person' is used in s 667AA. 22 The expert's report called for by s 667A must state whether, in the expert's opinion, terms proposed give a fair value and whether the person giving the compulsory acquisition notice has full beneficial ownership in at least 90 per cent by value of all the shares. I do not consider that the requirement that the report state an opinion requires that the expert be a natural person. 23 Certainly, a corporation can act only through its agents, including its directors and employees. It has long been accepted that a corporation, through its relevant agents, can acquire a state of mind, such as an intention; a corporation can, through its relevant agents, acquire knowledge. There is no reason, in principle, why a corporation cannot, through appropriate agents, form an opinion. 24 There is no indication in the scheme of Part 6A.4 that a natural person must take responsibility for the opinion expressed in an expert's report and must be able to support it on oath, as suggested by Dr Elkington. There is no requirement in the Act that an expert's report be verified on oath or by any other means. The person nominated, of course, must accept responsibility for the opinion. Doubtless, when considering a nomination, the Commission would have regard to the capacity of the person to be nominated to provide a reliable opinion. Even if a nomination by the Commission is subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that gives no hint that a nominated person must be a natural person and cannot be a corporation. 25 The word ' person ' is used throughout the Act to refer both to corporations and to natural persons. I do not consider that there is anything in the context in which s 667AA is found to suggest an intention contrary to the primary effect of s 22(1)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act . 26 That conclusion is supported by the scheme of the Act generally and Chapter 7 in particular. Chapter 7 is concerned with financial services and markets. Part 7.6 deals with the licensing of providers of financial services. Under s 911A, a person who carries on a financial services business must hold an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the financial services. It could not be suggested that a company is not a person for the purposes of s 911A. 27 Under s 766A, a person provides a financial service for the purposes of Chapter 7 if, amongst other things, the person provides financial product advice.    Under s 766B, financial product advice means, for the purposes of Chapter 7, a recommendation or a statement of opinion or a report of either of those things that is intended to influence a person or persons in making a decision in relation to a particular financial product. Under s 764A(1)(a), a security is a financial product and, by the operation of ss 761A and 9 , a share in a company is a security. 28 It follows that a person who provides an expert's report under s 667A must be the holder of an Australian financial services licence. Clearly, the Act contemplates that any holder of an Australian financial services licence could be nominated by the Commission to prepare an expert's report for the purposes of s 664C of the Act. While that is not decisive as to whether such an expert can be a company, it is persuasive of that conclusion. I consider that the nomination of Ernst & Young in the Commission's letter of 2 November 2005 was valid and effective. FAIR VALUE UNDER SECTION 667C 29 Section 667C of the Act provides how fair value for shares is to be determined for the purposes of Chapter 6A. There are three steps, the first of which, in the present context, is to assess the value of the Company as a whole . The second step only arises where there is more than one class of issued securities in a company, as is the present case. Thus, the issued capital of the Company consists of ordinary shares and preference shares. The value of the Company as a whole, determined in the first step, is then to be allocated between the ordinary shares and the preference shares in the Company. The value of each class of those classes is then to be allocated, pro rata , among the shares in that class. 30 The requirement of the third step, that the value of each class be allocated pro rata among the shares in that class, is a purely arithmetical process. However, the first and second steps call for judgment on the part of whoever is determining fair value. The first judgment is as to the value of the relevant company as a whole. The second judgment is as to the manner of allocating that value among the classes of issued shares. 31 To arrive at the value of property on a particular date, it is necessary to make a judgment as to the price at which the property would be sold on that date by voluntary bargaining between a seller and a buyer willing to trade, but neither of whom is so anxious to do so that the buyer or seller would overlook any ordinary business consideration. The judgment must be made on the assumption that both buyer and seller are perfectly acquainted with the property and cognisant of all circumstances that might affect its value, either advantageously or prejudicially.    Having placed itself in the position of such parties at the relevant date, the question for the decision maker to determine is the point at which the buyer and seller would meet: that is to say, the aim is to determine the sum that the buyer would be willing to pay and the price that the seller would be prepared to take (see Spencer v The Commonwealth [1907] HCA 70 ; (1907) 5 CLR 418 at 441). So much is undoubted. 32 However, the first question that arises in the present context is to determine just what is to be valued. Section 667C refers to ' the company as a whole '. That phrase signifies the overall enterprise or undertaking of the relevant company, in the sense of the whole of its assets and its liabilities as a going concern or as a cohesive collection of resources organised so as to produce a return through outlay. Attention is directed at the sum of the component parts, viewed as a productive organisational whole and not at any particular asset or advantage (see Teh v Ramsay Centauri Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 456 at [13] ). 33 In particular, the phrase does not direct attention to the value of particular share capital of the relevant company. On the other hand, dealings in the share capital of a company may give considerable assistance in the task of determining the value of that company as a whole. 34 The date as at which the value is to be determined is the date at which the 90% holder gives the relevant compulsory acquisition notice. It is at that point that the 90% holder initiates the process for compulsory acquisition. The holders of the shares that are to be subject to acquisition are drawn into a relationship with the 90% holder, whether they like it or not, by the operation of the Act (see Teh v Ramsay Centauri at [28]). THE E&Y REPORT 35 The E&Y Report did not directly address the question of the value of the Company as a whole, in the terms just outlined. The E&Y Report referred expressly to the provisions of s 667C(1) and referred to Practice Note 43, issued by the Commission, which provides guidance on possible valuation methodologies for an expert to consider. However, notwithstanding the express reference to s 667C(1), the E&Y Report adopted the approach of valuing the ordinary shares and the preference shares in the Company and then aggregating those values to arrive at the value of the Company as a whole. While, ultimately, the result of such an exercise may be helpful, that does not appear to me to be the approach called for by the terms of s 667C. Ernst & Young's Reasoning 36 The Company operates in the newspaper printing and publishing industry in Australia. The E&Y Report began with an overview of that industry followed by a profile of the Company. The core operating activity of the Company is publishing ' The Advocate ', a regional daily newspaper based in Burnie, Tasmania. The Company also operates a printing business which prints The Advocate as well as undertaking general printing for third parties.    The Company also has a 40 per cent interest in The Examiner Newspaper Pty Ltd, which publishes ' The Examiner ', a newspaper based in Launceston, Tasmania. 37 Ernst & Young's first step was to determine the value of the ordinary shares in the Company, using, as the primary methodology, prices paid for ordinary shares. Prior to September 2005, Regional had acquired 85.3 per cent of the ordinary shares in the Company, at a price of \\$32 per share. In September and November 2005, Regional acquired the 14.7 per cent of the ordinary shares in the capital of the Company that it did not own, at a price of \\$36.38 per share. Ernst & Young concluded that the ordinary shares should therefore be valued at \\$36.38 per share. On that basis, Ernst & Young concluded that the fair value of ' the ordinary equity ' in the Company was \\$55,821,000, as at 20 March 2006. 38 The second step taken in the E&Y Report was to consider the reasonableness of the value of \\$58,821,000 for the ordinary equity by reference to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA') of the Company. Ernst & Young had regard to the multiple of the Company's EBITDA that was implied by the value of \\$55,821,000 and the reasonableness of that value in the context of EBITDA multiples observed by Ernst & Young in respect of comparable listed entities and transactions. 39 In particular, Ernst & Young had regard to multiples observed in the Australian newspaper industry, including newspaper publishing companies and commercial printing companies, as follows: • Historical EBITDA trading multiples of similar companies operating in the Australian newspaper industry, having an average of 11.5. • Forecast EBITDA trading multiples of similar companies operating in the Australian newspaper industry, having an average of 11.1. • Historical EBITDA trading multiples of companies operating in the printing industry in Australia, having an average of 7.3. • Forecast EBITDA trading multiples of companies operating in the printing industry in Australia, having an average of 6.1. 40 Each of those multiples included a premium of 20 per cent for control. In addition, Ernst & Young considered the EBITDA multiples implied by other transactions in the newspaper industry. Finally, Ernst & Young had regard to the fact that the selected comparable companies are all much larger and diversified than the Company, which operates only in the small market of regional Tasmania, with limited readership. Such factors increase the exposure of smaller companies to the effects of recessions and other ' negative earnings shocks ', as Ernst & Young put it. 41 In the course of determining the implied EBITDA multiples, Ernst & Young derived an ' enterprise value ' for the Company. That entailed adding, to the value of the issued capital of the Company, the amount of the net debt of the Company, of \\$8,914,000, plus 40 per cent of the net debt of The Examiner Newspaper Pty Limited, of \\$3,700,000.    Ernst & Young concluded elsewhere in the E&Y Report, as indicated below, that the preference shares had a fair value of \\$54,000. Accordingly, the fair value of the total share capital of the Company was determined as \\$55,875,000, being \\$55,821,000 plus \\$54,000. The conclusion was an ' enterprise value ' for the Company of \\$68,489,000. 42 The Company's EBITDA for 2005 was \\$9,375,000 and the Company's forecast EBITDA for 2006 was \\$11,245,000. On the basis of an enterprise value of \\$68,489,000, the multiple for 2005 would be 7.3 and the multiple for 2006 would be 6.1. Those multiples for the years 2005 and 2006 were comparable with Ernst & Young's observations of other participants in the industry. The E&Y Report concluded, therefore, that the multiples of 7.3 and 6.1 were not unreasonable for a company engaged in the industry in which the Company is engaged. 43 Ernst & Young's third step was to determine the total value of the 50,000 issued preference shares in the Company by capitalising future maintainable dividends, including an allowance for franking credits. Ernst & Young considered that that was the appropriate methodology, having regard to the rights attached to those shares. That conclusion was based on an examination of the Company's capital structure and the rights and conditions attaching to the preference shares. 44 Clause 95 of the Company's Constitution sets out the terms and conditions upon which the directors were authorised to issue preference shares. Relevantly, terms and conditions of the preference shares include the following: • The shares carry the right to a fixed cumulative preferential dividend of 6 per cent per annum, or such other increased dividend as shall be determined by special resolution, on the capital paid up on the shares, such dividend to be payable on the last days of March and September in each year. • The shares rank, both as regards dividend and return of capital, in priority to all other shares in the Company, but confer no further rights to participate in profits or assets. • The capital paid up on the preference shares is not liable to cancellation or reduction. • Preference shareholders have the same rights as ordinary shareholders as regards receiving notices, reports and balance sheets and attending general meetings. However, preference shareholders have no right to vote at general meetings except in respect of specified matters that directly affect the preference shareholders. In such exempted matters, the preference shareholders were to have the same voting rights as ordinary shareholders. • There can be no creation or issue of further preference shares, beyond the first 130,000, no repayment of preference capital and no alteration of the rights of preference shareholders, unless agreed to by a resolution of the holders of at least three-fourths of the issued preference shares at a special meeting called for that purpose. 45 Ernst & Young considered that, in the light of clause 45, the key characteristics of the preference shares are as follows: • They have a face value of \\$1 and are fully paid.    • They attract a fixed preferential dividend of 6 per cent per annum, paid semi-annually in March and September of each year. • They are non-redeemable, in that a preference shareholder can realise the capital investment only by selling the preference shares or in a winding up. In the latter case, the preference shareholder would receive a maximum of \\$1 per share. 46 Ernst & Young considered that the preference shares could be characterised as being akin to a perpetual debt instrument, with no obligation to the Company to repay the capital subscribed, except on a winding up. Accordingly, the value of the preference shares was not directly dependent upon the value of the Company's assets unless it were to experience financial difficulties such that it was unable to make the preference share dividend payments or repay the capital upon a winding up. There was no evidence that any such circumstances existed. 47 Against that background, Ernst & Young adopted the methodology of capitalising future maintainable dividends, including an allowance for franking credits. Ernst & Young concluded, after conducting that exercise, that, depending upon the appropriate pre tax dividend yield adopted, the fair market value of each preference share was between \\$1.01 and \\$1.14. That gave a total fair market value of the issued preference shares of between \\$50,420 and \\$57,143, with a mid point of \\$54,000. 48 Ernst & Young then took into account the recent share trading history of the preference shares. Regional had purchased preference shares at \\$2 per share up to May 2004 and at \\$2.50 per share thereafter, giving an average price of \\$2.14 per share. Those prices are not higher than the price proposed under the compulsory acquisition notices. 49 The final step taken by Ernst & Young in the E&Y Report was to aggregate the value that had been determined for the ' ordinary equity ' in the Company and the value that had been determined for the preference shares. Ernst & Young concluded that the value of the Company as a whole was between \\$55,871,000 and \\$55,878,000, giving a mid point of \\$55,874,000. 50 Because of an argument that a special value should be attributed to financial benefits that would be derived by Regional's increasing its interest to 100 percent of the preference shares, Ernst & Young considered such potential ' special value '. Ernst & Young concluded that, in two areas, there were possible benefits for the Company. 51 First, Ernst & Young observed that, in the event that the remainder of the preference shares are required by Regional, the Company would no longer be required to produce separate statutory accounts or be the subject of a separate audit opinion. Ernst & Young assumed that the value of that benefit could be quantified at approximately \\$100,000 per annum. 52 Secondly, Ernst & Young postulated other minor benefits to Regional in not having minority shareholders in the Company.    Ernst & Young suggested that such benefits could include reduced administration costs and the avoidance of legal costs that might be required from time to time in relation to the outstanding holders of preference shares. While Ernst & Young considered that it was difficult to quantify such benefits, the assumption was made, for the purposes of the analysis, that such benefits could be in the order of \\$100,000. 53 Based on assumed savings of \\$200,000 per annum and the implied multiples referred to above, Ernst & Young concluded that such a special value could be considered to be in the order of \\$1,400,000. If the benefits of 100 per cent ownership by Regional are to be taken into account in determining the value of the Company as a whole, that would involve adding the sum of \\$1.4 million to the value otherwise determined. 54 Against the possibility that special value was relevant, Ernst & Young allocated the postulated special value of \\$1.4 million pro rata, based on the respective values of the ordinary shares and the preference shares, as determined above. On that basis, a special value of 3 cents would be allocated to each preference share. The result was a notional fair value per preference share, if special value is included, of between \\$1.03 and \\$1.17, giving a mid point of \\$1.10. Thus, Ernst & Young concluded that, even if special value is to be taken into account, the fair value for each preference share was still well below the price of \\$2.50 to be paid by Regional under the compulsory acquisition notices. Difficulties with the E&Y Report 55 In a sense, Ernst & Young approached the question from the wrong direction. That is to say, a valuation was carried out in relation to the two classes of shares and the two valuations were aggregated to arrive at the value of the Company as a whole. Ernst & Young did not directly consider the second step required by s 667C, although, by working backwards, the allocation of the value of the Company as a whole between the two classes of shares is simply a matter of examining the two valuations that were aggregated to produce the value of the Company as a whole. 56 The exercise conducted by Ernst & Young, in order to test the reasonableness of the value of ' the ordinary equity ', is really the exercise that should have been conducted as the primary first step. Thus, according to the Commission's Practice Note 43, an appropriate methodology for valuing a company as a whole is to apply earnings multiples appropriate to the businesses or industries in which that company is engaged, to the estimated future maintainable earnings or cash flows of that company. That figure would then be added to the estimated realisable value of any surplus assets. In effect, Ernst & Young determined a value of the Company as a whole as a check of its valuation of ' the ordinary equity ' in the Company. That value was the enterprise value of \\$68,489,000. 57 I do not consider that an addition for the special value identified in the E&Y Report is appropriate, having regard to the language of s 667C.    As I have said, the first step requires the determination of the value, as at the date of the compulsory acquisition notice, of the Company as a whole, in the sense indicated above. It is impermissible, in determining fair value, to make any allowance for synergies to be achieved by the acquisition. It is equally impermissible in determining fair value to take into account special benefits deriving from full ownership (see Winpar Holdings Ltd v Austrim Nylex Ltd [2005] VSCA 211 at [35] ). 58 I have taken some trouble to deal with Ernst & Young's opinion in some detail since, for the reasons I have indicated, I consider that it adopts an inappropriate approach. However, neither defendant suggested that such an inappropriate approach invalidated the process. That is to say, they accepted that it is a matter for the Court, on the basis of the evidence before it, which was limited to the Expert's Report, to determine whether Regional has established that \\$2.50 per preference share gives shareholders a fair value for the preference shares. FAIR VALUE FOR THE PREFERENCE SHARES 59 The defendants advanced arguments concerning the basis upon which the so-called special value should be allocated between ordinary shares and preference shares. The contention appears to be that Regional is a buyer of preference shares, and the present holders, apart from Regional, are sellers of preference shares. They suggested that it is necessary to allocate the special value of \\$1.4 million identified by Ernst & Young between Regional, on the one hand, and preference share holders, who include Regional, on the other hand. Something in the order of half and half was suggested as appropriate. The contention appears to be that that exercise should be undertaken as part of the allocation of the value of the Company as a whole between the two classes of shares. 60 However, the argument ignores the express terms of s 667C. The allocation between the two classes of shares is to be effected, taking into account the relative financial risk and voting and distribution rights of the classes. The Act does not require any other factor to be taken into account. Indeed, the presumed object of Part 6A(2), is to eliminate special value of the kind in question from the exercise that is to be undertaken in accordance with s 667C. Even if special value is to be taken into account, it is taken into account in the assessment of the value of the Company as a whole. There is no warrant in the Act for allocating special value of the kind in question between classes of shares on a basis different from the basis upon which the value of the Company as a whole is to be allocated. 61 The starting point is to determine the value of the Company as a whole. I consider that, on the material presently before me, the value of the Company as a whole can be postulated from the E&Y Report by applying appropriate multiples to the Company's EBITDA for 2005 and the Company's forecast EBITDA for 2006. According to the E&Y Report, multiples in the range 6.1 to 7.3 are reasonable.    The application of those multiples to the EBITDA for 2005 and 2006 results in a value of the Company as a whole, in the relevant sense, in the vicinity of \\$68,489,000. That is the figure determined by Ernst & Young as the enterprise value . 62 The defendants point out that the E&Y Report makes no attempt to determine maintainable EBITDA of the Company for the future. Rather, Ernst & Young simply looked at the Company's EBITDA for 2005 and the Company's forecast EBITDA for 2006, which exceeded actual EBITDA for 2005. Nevertheless, it is clear enough that the basis on which Ernst & Young proceeded is that the actual EBITDA and the forecast EBITDA give a reasonable indication of maintainable EBITDA. No evidence was adduced by the defendants to suggest that maintainable EBITDA of the Company was significantly greater than that forecast for 2006. 63 The defendants also contended that it is not open to Regional to choose its own multiple, which should be determined by an expert. However, it is clear, from the exercise carried out by Ernst & Young in the E&Y Report, that Ernst & Young, who clearly are experts, formed the view that multiples between 7.3 and 6.1 were reasonable for the Company. Again, no evidence was adduced by the defendants to suggest any other EBITDA multiple. 64 The real issue in the proceeding is the way in which the second step should be undertaken. That step requires the value of the Company as a whole to be allocated between the ordinary shares and the preference shares, being the only two classes of shares in the Company. Certainly, no formula is suggested by s 667C(1)(b). Gepps complained that Mr Bright, who was an author of the E&Y Report and who gave evidence and was cross-examined, did not explain the rationale for allocating the value between the two classes of shares on the basis of the market value of the shares. Dr Elkington, in written submissions made after the hearing, contended that the value of the Company as a whole should be allocated ' in the way that the market would allocate it '. 65 The only evidence as to that question was that of Ernst & Young, in the E&Y Report, to the effect that the appropriate manner of allocation is by reference to the market value of the two classes of shares. Ernst & Young suggest that the appropriate basis for allocation is valuation determined in the manner explained in the E&Y Report. The defendants adduced no alternative evidence as to the manner of valuing the two classes of shares. On the evidence before the Court, there is no reason to depart from the basis adopted by Ernst & Young in the E&Y Report. 66 Section 667C requires that, in making the allocation, it is necessary to take into account the relative financial risk and the voting and distribution rights of the ordinary shares and the preference shares.    In addition, it is necessary to take into account the price paid for the preference shares within the previous six months. 67 The ordinary shares bear a greater risk than the preference shares. That is to say, the preference shares confer the right to a return of paid up capital and a fixed dividend in priority to any distribution to the ordinary shares. However, to the extent that there is any excess profits or capital, that belongs entirely to the ordinary shareholders. The preference shareholders have a right to receive a dividend of 6 per cent per annum and no more, whereas the ordinary shareholders are entitled to distribution of all profits that are distributed. On a winding up, any surplus beyond the paid up capital of the preference shares and any outstanding fixed dividend on the preference shares goes entirely to the holders of the ordinary shares. The preference shareholders are not entitled to vote except in relation to matters that specifically concern their rights. 68 The right to receive accounts and to attend meetings and the right to vote in relation to matters that affect preference share rights directly are merely incidents of the right to receive the fixed dividend and to a right to return of the paid up capital on the winding up, in priority to any distribution or return to the holders of ordinary shares. While, under the constitution of the Company the preference capital cannot be repaid without the agreement of the holders of at least three-fourths of the preference shares, that right is expressly abrogated, in effect, by the operation of Part 6A.2 of the Act. That is to say, but for Part 6A.2, the holders of the preference shares would be entitled to continue to hold their shares in perpetuity, subject to the winding up of the Company and subject to agreement by the holders of three-fourths of the preference shares. 69 In the circumstances, I consider that it is appropriate to allocate the total value of the Company as a whole between the preference shares and the ordinary shares on the basis of their respective values, as determined by Ernst & Young. If the value of the Company as a whole is not to take account of the special value, the enterprise value of \\$68,489,000 would be the value of the Company as a whole, although it might be greater if the Company's maintainable EBITDA were greater than was impliedly assumed by Ernst & Young. Assuming, contrary to the view expressed above, that the special value should be brought into the calculation of the value of the Company as a whole, the sum of \\$1,400,000 would be added to the amount of \\$68,489,000, to give a value of the Company as a whole in the vicinity of \\$70 million. 70 Ernst & Young concluded that the respective market values of the ordinary share capital and the preference share capital were \\$55,821,000 and \\$54,000. On that basis, the allocation of \\$70 million would be \\$69,932,349 to the ordinary share capital and \\$67,651 to the preference share capital. If the latter figure is allocated among the 50,000 preference shares pro rata, a fair value for each preference share would be \\$1.35.    CONCLUSION 71 While \\$1.35 is greater than the figure determined by Ernst & Young, it is significantly below the price proposed in the compulsory acquisition notice, of \\$2.50 for each preference share. The maintainable EBITDA would have to be significantly above the figures for 2005 and 2006 in order to result in an allocation of the value of the Company as a whole to the preference shares that would result in a figure that was close to \\$2.50. 72 It follows that the terms of the compulsory acquisition notice give a fair value for the preference shares. It is appropriate, therefore, to make the order asked by Regional, approving the acquisition of the preference shares under the compulsory acquisition notices. Regional should pay the costs of Dr Elkington and Gepps, as provided by s 664F(4). I certify that the preceding seventy-two (72) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.

The application brought before the Federal Magistrate sought judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('Tribunal') made on 30 September 2004 adversely to the applicant's claim for refugee status advanced pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). 2 The applicant is a citizen of India. The essence of his claim before the Tribunal was that he was not protected in India after he was attacked 'many times' by his paternal uncle. He claimed that his uncle, who belonged to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), killed his father, a political leader of the Congress Party, and forced the applicant to transfer the family property to his uncle. 3 The Tribunal did not accept at least the essence of that claim to refugee status, and in so doing, made credibility findings to the applicant's case. In particular the Tribunal found that the applicant's testimony tendered at the Tribunal was inconsistent in material aspects, and that medical documents provided by him were unrelated to the applicant's protection visa claim. Moreover the Tribunal found that the applicant's claims made in response to issues that arose concerning relocation were fabricated. The Tribunal hence concluded that an essential and significant reason for the applicant's alleged difficulties encountered in his country of origin were not founded upon or referrable to any Convention reason, and that he had not been targeted for political reasons. The Tribunal further found in any event that State protection would be available to him on his return in the future to his country of origin, and that he could reasonably relocate within India to escape any harm of the nature which he had postulated to the Tribunal. 4 In the presentation of his case to the Federal Magistrate below, the applicant claimed that the Tribunal did not properly consider evidence which he had tendered to the Tribunal, and that the Tribunal's decision had no rational basis. He further claimed unspecifically that the Tribunal did not observe the relevant requirements of the Act, and failed in any event to provide him with particulars of country information said to have been relied upon, and otherwise to give him an adequate opportunity to respond to the evidence adduced and submissions made by the Minister. He asserted moreover that the Tribunal made credibility findings that were 'objectionable'. 5 In the course of its consideration of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision in light of the applicant's submissions, Lloyd-Jones FM found that the grounds of appeal raised by the applicant could not be sustained.    The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had made findings that were open on the evidence placed before it, and moreover that no jurisdictional error was identifiable in relation to the Tribunal's conduct of its procedures or in its reasons for decision. 6 In support of the application for an extension of time generally, the applicant provided an affidavit stating that he thought he was allowed a period of 28 days to file an appeal. The applicant also produced a draft notice of appeal upon grounds to the effect that the Federal Magistrate below erred in not holding that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration, being the fact that his father was killed by his uncle for a political reason, and in considering whether the applicant was a member of a particular social group comprising his family members. The applicant asserted a fear for his own life at the instance of his uncle. 7 Finally I would record that the applicant handed to the Court a written request which I have literally reproduced below: 'To The dimia ... [I] would like to request to give me bridging b visa with a validity of 11 months time and I am going to cancel my case from federal court. The reason why I am asking for the bridging b as I said I donot have protection in my country now the opponents and some of our people they would like to comprosmise. Now why I am asking for 11 months time is if there is any delay or some thing happen with them so I can get back to here. Any way after 11 months I have to leave the country. And I am going to with the case from the court And I am going to pay \\$4000AU to Dimia for lost the case in court. ' It is necessarily of course a matter for the Minister whether or not she would accede to the foregoing request for a temporary stay in Australia, that being of course something outside the scope of any appeal which be granted from the decision of the Federal Magistrate. The only observation that I can make in relation to that subject is that which the applicant presented to the Court. 8 It should be observed that Order 52 rule 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules ('the FCR') states that a notice of appeal shall be filed and served within 21 days after the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced. The applicant filed an application for an extension of time on the 21 February 2006, some six days after the allowable time period to file a notice of appeal. However, by Order 52 rule 15(2) of the FCR, the time limit of 21 days may be extended where a 'special reason' exists. 9 The respondent submitted that even if a 'special reason' existed in this case, 'an extension [of time] should not be granted because the proposed appeal has insufficient prospects of success; the respondent citing WAAD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at [9] per Lee, Nicholson and Finkelstein JJ, in support of that contention. 10 In my opinion no error has been identified in the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate below.    Consequently, I can find no conceivable basis propounded by the applicant for the grant of the extension of time to appeal which he seeks. Whether the Minister is prepared to accede to the request for a moratorium upon the time for his return to India is of course a matter for the Minister's decision-making.

The relief sought is as follows: (1) A direction that the plaintiff, in his capacity as administrator of the deed of company arrangement for Aliance, is justified in acting on the basis that his remuneration as administrator and as deed administrator has been and was properly fixed by resolutions of the creditors of Aliance passed at a meeting of them convened under s 439A and held on 15 July 2005. (2) Alternatively, a declaration that the plaintiff, in his capacity as administrator of the deed of company arrangement for Aliance, is justified in acting on the basis that his remuneration as administrator and as deed administrator has been and was properly fixed by resolutions of creditors of Aliance passed at a meeting of them convened under s 439A and held on 15 July 2005. 2 I am informed that these proceedings are brought by way of a 'test case' principally to resolve a controversy between the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia (IPAA), which is a professional organisation for persons practising in corporate and personal insolvency, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) as to whether the remuneration of an administrator, or of an administrator under a DOCA, can be fixed at a meeting held under s 439A prospectively, by reference to a scale of hourly rates, subject to a monetary cap. ASIC appeared by leave as amicus curiae in order to assist the Court by making submissions as a contradictor. Although notice of this proceeding has been given to interested parties, none has sought to appear. Whilst there is much to be said for facilitating the resolution of the issue, the matter is not without procedural complications. The direction is sought pursuant to s 447D of the Act which provides: '(1) The administrator of a company under administration, or of a deed of company arrangement, may apply to the Court for directions about a matter arising in connection with the performance or exercise of any of the administrator's functions and powers. (2) The administrator of a deed of company arrangement may apply to the Court for directions about a matter arising in connection with the operation of, or giving effect to, the deed. ' 3 The declaration sought in the alternative is based upon s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).    The limits to the exercise of that jurisdiction in circumstances such as the present have been explained in Mentha v GE Capital Ltd (1997) 154 ALR 565 at 571---575. It is clear enough that the present constitution of the proceeding is not appropriate for the making of a declaration of right. 4 The nature, effect, and limit upon directions that may be given pursuant to s 447D have been explained in Editions Tom Thompson Pty Ltd v Pilley (1997) 148 ALR 146 at 151---155; Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha [2002] FCA 2 ; (2002) 188 ALR 186; Re Ansett Australia Ltd (2001) 39 ACSR 355; 19 ACLC 1678 at [58]---[69]; and Re Pasminco [2004] FCA 656 ; (2004) 22 ACLC 774; 49 ACSR 470 at [2] ---[9] and need not be repeated. 5 ASIC drew attention to two possible questions beyond the issue raised which might cast doubt upon making of the direction as sought. The first is whether sufficient information was provided to creditors concerning the basis upon which the remuneration was calculated in the case of resolution 1. The second is whether a resolution purporting to fix the remuneration, inter alia, of partners and staff of an administrator, relevantly deals with the remuneration of the administrator for the purposes of s 449E in the case of resolutions 1 and 2. I shall return to the procedural question having considered the substance of the matter at issue. RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS 6 Section 449E of the Act relevantly provides: 'Remuneration of administrator (1) The administrator of a company under administration, or of a deed of company arrangement, is entitled to: (a) such remuneration as is fixed by a resolution of the company's creditors passed at a meeting convened under section 439A, or under section 439A or 445F, as the case may be; or (b) if no remuneration is so fixed--such remuneration as the Court fixes on the application of the administrator. (2) Where remuneration is fixed under paragraph (1)(a), the Court may, on the application of the administrator or of an officer, member or creditor of the company: (a) review the remuneration; and (b) confirm, increase or reduce it. (3) Subsection (2) has effect despite section 437C. ' 7 Section 439A provides (so far as is relevant): 'Administrator to convene meeting and inform creditors (1) The administrator of a company under administration must convene a meeting of the company's creditors within the convening period as fixed by subsection (5) or extended under subsection (6). ' ... (4) The notice given to a creditor under paragraph (3)(a) must be accompanied by a copy of: (a) a report by the administrator about the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances; and (b) a statement setting out the administrator's opinion about each of the following matters: (i) whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the company to execute a deed of company arrangement; (ii) whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the administration to end; (iii) whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the company to be wound up; and his or her reasons for those opinions; and (c) if a deed of company arrangement is proposed--a statement setting out details of the proposed deed.    (5) The convening period is: (a) if the administration begins on a day that is in December, or is less than 28 days before Good Friday--the period of 28 days beginning on that day; or (b) otherwise--the period of 21 days beginning on the day when the administration begins. (6) The Court may extend the convening period on an application made within the period referred to in paragraph (5)(a) or (b), as the case requires. 8 Section 439B(2) is as follows: 'A meeting convened under section 439A may be adjourned from time to time, but cannot be adjourned to a day that is more than 60 days after the first day on which the meeting was held, even if no resolution under section 439C has been passed at the meeting. ' 9 Section 439C is as follows: 'At a meeting convened under section 439A, the creditors may resolve: (a) that the company execute a deed of company arrangement specified in the resolution (even if it differs from the proposed deed (if any) details of which accompanied the notice of meeting); or (b) that the administration should end; or (c) that the company be wound up. ' 10 Section 445F(1) provides: ' Meeting of creditors to consider proposed variation or termination of deed (1) The administrator of a deed of company arrangement: (a) may at any time convene a meeting of the company's creditors; and (b) must convene such a meeting if so requested in writing by creditors the value of whose claims against the company is not less than 10% of the value of all the creditors' claims against the company. ' BACKGROUND 11 On 20 June 2005, by resolution of its board, Aliance appointed Gidley and Stewart William Free (Free) as joint and several voluntary administrators of the company under s 436A of the Act. The first meeting of creditors was held pursuant to s 436E of the Act on 27 June 2005. The second meeting of creditors was held pursuant to s 439A of the Act on 15 July 2005. At that meeting, the creditors resolved that the company should execute a DOCA with Gidley as the deed administrator. 12 At the meeting of 15 July 2005, the creditors passed three resolutions that related to remuneration. The first two resolutions related to the remuneration of the administrators of Aliance and the last resolution related to the remuneration of the administrator of the DOCA. The resolutions were as follows (numbered for ease of reference): 1. Remuneration of Administrators That the remuneration of the Joint and Several Administrators his partners and staff, for the period 20 June 2005 to the (sic) 15 July 2005, be approved on a time basis in accordance with Lawler Partners guide to hourly rates in the amount of \\$34,703 plus GST in the amount of \\$3,470.30. Disbursements are additional. 2. Remuneration of Administrators (until Deed executed) That the remuneration of the Joint and Several Administrators their partners and staff be approved for the period    Friday 15 July 2005 to the date the Deed of Company Arrangement is executed on a time basis at hourly rates outlined in Lawler Partners guide to hourly rates and that the Administrators be authorised to make periodic payments on account of such accruing remuneration to a limit of \\$5,000 plus GST in the amount of \\$500. 3. Remuneration of Deed Administrator That the remuneration of the Deed Administrator be approved up to a limit of \\$30, 000.00 plus GST in the amount of \\$3, 000 on a time basis at hourly rates outlined in Lawler Partners guide to hourly rates. Disbursements are additional. 13 Gidley and Free are partners in the firm of Lawler Partners. The Lawler Partners Guide to Hourly Rates was included in the Administrator's Report to Creditors. A copy is annexed to these reasons, omitting the stated rates. 14 The DOCA was executed on 28 July 2005. Clause (8.5.1) appears as follows: 'The Creditors have approved the following fees and disbursements associated with the Company's voluntary administration and Deed administration: Voluntary administration \\$43,673 inclusive of GST Deed administration \\$33,000 inclusive of GST' 15 The principal controversy concerns the second and third of the resolutions, in that they are prospective in effect and are expressed by reference to a scale of hourly rates subject to monetary caps. The issues that arise are whether the remuneration of an administrator is 'fixed', within the meaning of s 449E of the of the Act, by a resolution of creditors which: (1) approves remuneration where the amount is calculated by application of specified hourly rates to whatever time may be spent on the administration by the administrator, and his or her partners and/or staff; or (2) approves remuneration of any amount up to a certain limit or cap where the amount is calculated by application of specified hourly rates to whatever time may be spent on the administration by the administrator, and his or her partners and/or staff. STOCKFORD 16 The decision of Finkelstein J in Re Korda; in the matter of Stockford Ltd [2004] FCA 1682 ; (2004) 140 FCR 424 ( Stockford ) drew attention to some issues relating to the fixing of the remuneration of administrators and has indirectly led to the present proceeding. Finkelstein J said (at [5]): 'Although s 449E requires the remuneration to be \\\"fixed\\\" by the creditors or the court, the section does not specify how it is to be \\\"fixed\\\". It could be \\\"fixed\\\" as a periodic salary, a lump sum, a percentage of some amount (such as the value of the company's assets under the administrators' control) or according to the amount of time spent by the administrator determined by reference to a scale or formula. The matter is simply left at large. So also is the basis upon which the quantum of the remuneration is to be determined. That is, the section is silent on the factors to be taken into account both for deciding the appropriate method of \\\"fixing\\\" an administrator's remuneration and in determining the amount to be \\\"fixed\\\".    The only guidance that is given, and it is given by necessary implication, is that an administrator is entitled to reasonable remuneration. That offers little assistance to the tribunal that is required to decide what is reasonable in a particular case. ' 17 It will be observed that the reference to 'reasonable' remuneration is a gloss upon the words of the Act and is described by his Honour as arising from 'necessary implication'. That implication may, no doubt, be given effect to in the operation of s 449E(2) but is of doubtful relevance to the construction of s 449E(1). There is much else of relevance in the judgment in Stockford which is too lengthy to reproduce but some other passages repay reproduction. His Honour said (at [24] and [30]---[31]): 'The natural meaning of the word \\\"fix\\\" in the context of an entitlement to \\\"such remuneration as is fixed by a resolution of [creditors]\\\" is, so it seems to me, to quantify that remuneration, that is to calculate or ascertain the amount of remuneration: Mayne v Jaques [1960] HCA 23 ; (1960) 101 CLR 169, 173, 174, 180. See also In re Gallard; Ex parte Harris [1892] 1 QB 532, 544. Thus, remuneration will be \\\"fixed\\\" if it is stated as a money sum, or is based on a formula which is capable of being applied according to some objective standard so the sum \\\"can be calculated or ascertained definitely\\\": Fraser Henleins v Cody [1945] HCA 49 ; (1945) 70 CLR 100, 128. In the case of a formula all the objective elements must be identified. Other cases which support this approach in related contexts include, in Canada: Hill v State (1913) 14 DLR 158, 163; Beuregard v The Queen in right of Canada (1983) 148 DLR (3d) 205, 235; Royal Bank of Canada v Bjorklund (1985) 36 Man R (2d) 54, 59; and in the United States: Zimmerman v Carfield 42 Ohio St 463, 468 (1885); Board of Supervisors of Yavapai County v Stephens 177 P 261, 262 (1919); Culberson v Watkins 119 SE 319, 322 (1923); Woodcock v Dick 222 P 2d 667, 669 (1950); Powers v Isley 183 P 2d 880, 884 (1974). ... 'The question arises whether the approval of prospective fees charged on a time basis amounts to \\\"fixing\\\" or \\\"determining\\\" the liquidator's remuneration. On one view such approval does no more than fix the rate at which remuneration is to be charged; as the method sets no limit to the amount to be charged it may not \\\"fix\\\" the remuneration. At least there must be real doubt about the validity of the practice. It is not, however, a matter which I need resolve, for the issue does not arise squarely on the facts and no submissions were directed to the question. To reach a concluded view would require consideration of, among other things, the knowledge of the practice by Parliament when the Companies Acts were re-enacted or amended. If Parliament knew of the practice and did not change the statute that is relevant to its interpretation.    I should say that if the practice be irregular that would not mean that a liquidator must complete his administration before he receives any remuneration. He could be allowed interim remuneration while work is being performed, leaving the precise amount of his remuneration to be fixed when the winding up is complete. In any event, the problem may not be as large as at first it seems. Oftentimes, especially in a complex administration, it will be too difficult to fix fees prospectively having regard to the matters that should be taken into account, as I will later explain. For this reason courts have from time to time refused to fix fees prospectively: for instance Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Company Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236. Be that as it may, whatever be the correct meaning of \\\"fixing\\\" remuneration, it was not \\\"fixed\\\" in this case. The resolutions purporting to fix the administrators' remuneration did so by reference to the rates in the administrators' report. According to those rates work performed by persons occupying the same position could attract a different hourly charge. There was no criteria by reference to which one could determine which hourly charge would be applied. In reality it was left to the administrators to decide what the rate would be. In this state of affairs it was the administrators and not the creditors who fixed their remuneration. ' [emphasis added] 18 Finkelstein J did not decide the point at issue here in Stockford . It is also notable that much of the discussion in Stockford related not so much to the question of whether fees are 'fixed' but whether the fees, if fixed, are reasonable. ARGUMENTS 19 The plaintiff submits that the principle to be applied in this case is succinctly extracted by Finkelstein J in the passage highlighted above from the judgment of Dixon J in Fraser Henleins Pty Ltd & Crowther v Cody [1945] HCA 49 ; (1945) 70 CLR 100 at 128. That passage is consistent with a series of other decisions concerning the wartime regulations, decided at about the same time, including Vardon v Commonwealth [1943] HCA 30 ; (1943) 67 CLR 434; Cann's Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [1946] HCA 5 ; (1946) 71 CLR 210; and King Gee Clothing Co Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184. 20 It is submitted for the plaintiff that the resolutions in the present case do not suffer from the defect which existed in Stockford as there is only one rate fixed for each person who does any work in connection with the administration. Once the person and his or her category is known, and the time spent is known, the guide can be arithmetically applied to arrive at the result. Thus, the resolution here does avoid one of the problems which brought down the arrangement in Stockford . Counsel also relied upon the specific monetary limits or caps to avoid the criticism that the arrangements would otherwise be open ended.    21 It is submitted for ASIC, however, that whilst this formula may have the appearance of objectivity and certainty, that appearance is misleading. It is submitted that the charge out rates cannot be applied until various issues involving a considerable degree of subjectivity, assessment, discretionary allocation or apportionment have been determined. It is submitted that these subjective elements include assessing which tasks should be claimed for, apportioning the time taken on tasks that relate to more than just the particular administration in question, allocating the tasks to staff with the appropriate level of seniority, and assessing the actual number of hours to be claimed in respect of each task and of each member of staff having regard to such matters as, for example, work redone as a result of mistake or carelessness, the efficiency or inefficiency of the staff member, the quality of the work and so on. It is submitted that these discretionary elements mean that, in effect, the actual fixing of the amount is left to the administrators rather than to the creditors or to the Court as provided for by the Act. This is said to be an impermissible delegation of power ( Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Qld) [1979] HCA 50 ; (1979) 142 CLR 460 at 481). It is submitted that all that is fixed is a rate for certain tasks rather than remuneration for the work done or to be done. 22 ASIC pointed to the potential for abuse if the plaintiff's construction were adopted, bearing in mind that creditors may not be sufficiently well informed or have sufficient funds to properly scrutinise what was proposed or to bring the matter to the Court pursuant to s 449E(2). It was also submitted that there are traditional methods of fixing remuneration other than by way of lump sum or time charging, for example, by way of a percentage of the value of assets dealt with. Counsel for ASIC also did not accept that, generally speaking, remuneration could or should be fixed prospectively. 23 It is submitted for ASIC that, according to the plaintiff's construction, the power to 'fix' remuneration is conferred in general terms and applies whether or not the administrator has performed all or any of the services for which he or she is to be remunerated. In other words, remuneration may be both retrospective and prospective. There is nothing to suggest that 'fix' will have a different meaning when considering prospective remuneration as opposed to retrospective remuneration. It is submitted that it would be insufficient when fixing retrospective remuneration on a time basis for decision making bodies simply to be given the hourly charge out rate for approval. More would be required. This should also be the case in fixing prospective remuneration. It is also submitted that, as a court has the power to 'fix' fees, it is to be assumed that the Court would require similar information.    As this cannot be given in relation to prospective fixing, it follows that an hourly rate basis is inappropriate for all relevant purposes. 24 It is submitted on behalf of ASIC that the relevant extrinsic material does not support the plaintiff's proposition. The Explanatory Memorandum of the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1992 referred to the 1988 Law Reform Commission Report known as the 'Harmer Report' ( General Insolvency Inquiry , Australian Law Reform Commission, Report No 45 (1988) (Harmer Report) which, it is submitted, effectively rejected the approach contended for as follows: 'The Commission does not support the concept of prospective approval as proposed so that creditors at a meeting need only be advised that the approved scale was being used. In the Commission's view prospective approval creates a risk of over-servicing and denies creditors an opportunity of reaching an informed view as to whether the remuneration actually paid is justified. The remuneration of liquidators (which is from time to time the subject of complaint) should be properly regulated and subject to the approval of creditors. ' It is said that the Harmer Report formed the basis for the 1992 amendments incorporating s 449E. 25 Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that, as s 449E contemplates that remuneration may be fixed before all (or perhaps any) work is done either in the administration or under the DOCA, there would be serious practical problems if the view contended for by ASIC were adopted. It is most unlikely that the intended consequence of the legislation was that prospective remuneration could only be fixed by way of a specific monetary amount. The size and complexity of administrations vary so much that the precise work to be undertaken may not be capable of reliable estimation in advance. It may thus not be practicable to agree on a fixed amount. There would also be a tendency to 'load' the amount because of risk. If fees could only be fixed retrospectively, the administrator would be at risk as to his or her remuneration during the period when the work is required to be performed. Further, additional meetings of creditors would be required, with consequent expense. 26 It was also submitted for the plaintiff that the extrinsic material did not support ASIC's position and that the extract taken from the Harmer Report above (para [24]), referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1992, in particular did not assist in deciding the present controversy as there is no sufficient connection between the recommendations of the Harmer Report, on the one hand, and the legislation as drafted some years later, on the other, to make the passage relied upon by ASIC a safe guide to construction of the section. 27 Counsel for ASIC responded to the argument based upon practical inconvenience by suggesting that interim payments could be authorised, as suggested by Finkelstein J in Stockford (at [30]) or that a certain monetary sum could be fixed on the basis that the administrator should have the right to seek further remuneration at a later meeting (cf Re Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Limited (1931) 48 WN (NSW) 236).    (See also Re Clynton Court Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement); Korda (as joint and several deed administrators of Clynton Court Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement v The J Aron Corporation (2005) 53 ACSR 432; (2005) 23 ACLC 710; [2005] FCA 543. ) ASIC suggested that the convenience of avoiding additional meetings be given little, if any, weight. DECISION 28 For the purposes of argument, I construe s 449E(1) as providing that the remuneration of the administrator of a company under administration is to be fixed by resolution of the company's creditors, passed at a meeting convened under s 439A but that the remuneration of the administrator of a DOCA may be fixed by resolution of the company's creditors at a meeting convened under either s 439A or s 445F. It would follow that the remuneration of an administrator of a company under administration would normally be fixed substantially retrospectively, having in mind the timing and purpose of a s 439A meeting, but that of the administrator of a DOCA could be fixed prospectively. In the normal case, the deed might well include a clause relating to remuneration (as in this case) and there might also be a separate resolution in relation to remuneration at the meeting pursuant to s 439A which resolves to execute the deed. Furthermore, there is no restriction as to when a s 445F meeting should take place. There will often be an expectation that a deed of company arrangement will be administered for a reasonably lengthy period of time although the same may not be true of the administration of a company, with some notable exceptions. It follows that s 449E contemplates the fixing of remuneration prospectively, at least in many cases. 29 In my opinion, there is no escape from the conclusion that, if remuneration is to be fixed prospectively, it may be fixed by reference to a formula based upon time, provided that the formula is objective enough to satisfy the tests laid down by the High Court in the wartime line of authority to which reference has been made. That is the ordinary and natural meaning of the provision. I see no warrant for departing from this meaning because of the extrinsic material which is equivocal at best. 30 I appreciate the force of the concern expressed on behalf of ASIC as to the potential for abuse in relation to time charging which echoes concerns expressed by Finkelstein J and other judges. That is not a reason for precluding it as a method of remuneration in an age where it has become ubiquitous in relation to the provision of professional services. Parliament has provided the necessary safeguards. The first safeguard is that remuneration may only be fixed by a resolution of the company's creditors or by the Court. It may not be fixed by the administrator. The second safeguard is that there is a full review by the Court available on the application of any officer, member or creditor of the company.    In my opinion, those safeguards ought to be allowed to operate without artificially constraining the concept of 'fixing' of remuneration by means of unexpressed implications. I should add that doubts expressed as to the application of s 449E have led to the utilisation of the extraordinary provisions of s 447A on many occasions to cure perceived problems including the authorisation of interim payments. In my opinion, Parliament would not have intended that this should be necessary. 31 The resolutions in question in this case are capable of objective application. All of the necessary elements can be objectively identified. The person doing the work, that person's category and the period spent are all the elements required. The sum can be calculated or ascertained definitely. If that produces an unreasonable result by reason of the factors referred to by counsel for ASIC, or otherwise, then the remedy is an application for review by the Court pursuant to s 449E(2). I do not agree that the effect of the resolutions here is to enable the plaintiff to fix the remuneration. I should add that, in my opinion, the provision for a cap is not relevant to deciding whether or not remuneration has been 'fixed'. At the time the resolution was passed, there was no certainty that the cap would be reached. Therefore, it is not a sum certain. A cap may, however, be relevant to the question of reasonableness which would arise if there is a challenge by any officer, member or creditor of the company to the remuneration fixed. 32 I thus uphold the plaintiff's position on the critical issue concerning the proper construction of s 449E(1). As pointed out earlier, ASIC has pointed to two other issues which might be said to go to the validity of the resolutions in question. I make no comment as to whether those issues would in truth go to validity as no officer, member or creditor of the company has raised either of them. Bearing in mind the limited nature and effect of giving a direction pursuant to s 447D, I propose to give the direction sought. It will protect the plaintiff but does not bind others. These reasons will make clear the limited basis upon which the direction is given. 33 It is not appropriate to make any order for the costs of this proceeding. It has been brought in order to resolve a matter of general interest that has not been raised by any party interested in the particular company. The result is to the benefit of the plaintiff. I certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.

The Magistrate made an order dismissing an application under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). 2 The application to the Federal Magistrates Court under s 476 of the Act was supported by an affidavit as required by r 44.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 and it came before the Magistrate on a first court date on 30 January 2006. At that time, it was not clear to the Magistrate that the application disclosed an arguable case and, accordingly, he listed the matter for a hearing under r 44.12 so that he could determine whether the application raised an arguable case. He gave the applicant the opportunity to amend her application and to file further affidavits. No further affidavits were filed. Two amended applications were filed, but it is unnecessary for me to set out the details of those applications. 3 The hearing under r 44.12 took place on 3 March 2006. The Magistrate concluded that the application failed to disclose an arguable case within r 44.12(1)(a) and, accordingly, he dismissed it. 4 On 23 March 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal from the decision in this Court. Rule 44.12(2) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 makes it clear that an order for dismissal under paragraph (1)(a) is an interlocutory order. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs filed a notice of objection to competency of the appeal and submits that the appeal is not competent in the absence of a grant of leave to appeal. In my opinion, that submission is correct. The order made by the Magistrate is interlocutory, and under s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), leave to appeal is required. The Minister does not object to me treating the purported notice of appeal as an application for leave to appeal, and I think that that is the appropriate course. The test for granting leave to appeal is well known and I will not repeat it: Decor Corporation v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399-400. 5 The applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China, and she arrived in Australia on 15 March 2005. On 26 April 2005, she lodged an application for a protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs under the Act. On 5 August 2005, a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused to grant a protection visa. On 6 September 2005, the applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of that decision.    6 The applicant was born on 6 March 1957 and she claims that she is one of the leaders of Falon Gong in Shanghai, China. She claims that the Chinese authorities regard Falon Gong as an illegal organisation. She claims that she helped to organise a number of activities related to Falon Gong. She claims that she was warned about her involvement in Falon Gong by the local police and local government. She claims that in April 2001, she was put into detention for one month. She claims that in October 2002, she was ordered to attend a 're-education' centre for two months. She claims that in May 2003, she was imprisoned for one week because an unidentified person told the police that she practised Falon Gong every day. 7 On 28 September 2005, the Tribunal wrote to the applicant and advised her that it had considered the material before it in relation to the application, but was unable to make a decision in her favour on that information alone. The applicant was invited to attend a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence and present arguments in support of her claims. She was told that if she did not attend the hearing and if the Tribunal did not postpone the hearing, then the Tribunal could make a decision on her case without further notice. She was advised that the proposed hearing would take place on 28 October 2005. 8 The applicant did not attend the proposed hearing of the Tribunal. On 31 October 2005, she was advised that the Tribunal had made a decision, and that it would hand down its decision on 22 November 2005. The Tribunal decided to affirm the decision of the delegate of the Minister. 9 In the course of its reasons, the Tribunal said: 'Generally, where broad allegations are made, the Tribunal hearing is an opportunity for the Tribunal to gather detail about the claims with the applicant. The applicant has been put on notice by the Tribunal that it is unable to make a favourable decision on the information before it but has not provided any further information in support of her claims despite ample opportunity to do so. Nor has she given the Tribunal the opportunity to explore aspects of her claims with her. A number of relevant questions are therefore left unanswered. At hearing, for example, I would have wanted to satisfy myself that the applicant is indeed a genuine Falon Gong practitioner. I have been unable to do that. As to her claims to have been detained at various times, I would have wanted to hear more details about the circumstances to satisfy myself that that really occurred. I have been unable to do that. Finally, I would have wanted to know why she did not leave China for nearly two years after her last detention. ' 10 The applicant raised two main points before the Magistrate. First, she asserted that the Tribunal did not comply with its obligation under s 425 of the Act to invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments.    Secondly, she asserted that the Tribunal did not comply with its obligation under s 424A of the Act, in that it did not give her particulars of relevant information. The specific information she asserted that the Tribunal was obliged to disclose was the fact that it would draw an adverse inference against her by reason of the fact that she did not leave China for nearly two years after her last detention. 11 The Magistrate rejected both of these grounds. In essence, the applicant submitted that he erred in doing so. 12 As to the first ground, the Magistrate made findings of fact which establish that the Tribunal met its obligation under s 425 of the Act to invite the applicant to a hearing and that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed in the absence of the applicant when she failed to appear at the time and place fixed for the hearing. The applicant did not identify any error in relation to those findings. 13 As to the second ground, the Magistrate rejected the challenge of the Tribunal's approach for a number of reasons. First, he concluded that all the Tribunal member was saying was that that was an issue that he would like to have explored with the applicant and that that was not an error. Secondly, the comment was based on information provided by the applicant, and, accordingly, did not need to be disclosed by reason of the provisions of s 424A(3)(b) of the Act. Thirdly, the Magistrate said that the information did not need to be disclosed because it was the insufficiency of the information that was determinative and not any particular information contained in the visa application. The Magistrate referred to the decision in SZBCS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1457. I agree with each of the reasons identified by the Magistrate. His conclusions are supported by authority, including VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 per Finn and Stone JJ at 476-477, at [24] and SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238. 14 Neither ground of challenge is arguable and, in those circumstances, the application for leave to appeal must be dismissed with costs. I will hear the parties as to whether I should order costs in a fixed amount pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules .

In making the application the plaintiff relies on the defendant's failure to comply with a statutory demand, served in accordance with s 459E of the Corporations Act . Background 2 By notices of assessment issued on or about 1 June 2005, the defendant company was assessed for superannuation guarantee charges and additional charges for the years ended 30 June 2001 and 30 June 2002. On or about 6 October 2005, notices of assessment of superannuation guarantee charges and additional charges for the year ended 30 June 2003 and the quarters ended 30 September 2003, 31 December 2003, 31 March 2004, 30 June 2004, 30 September 2004, 31 December 2004, 31 March 2005 and 30 June 2005 issued to the defendant. 3 The assessments remained unpaid and, on 11 July 2006, the plaintiff issued a statutory demand in the prescribed form for a debt of \\$176,146.97, being the sum then due by the defendant to the Commonwealth of Australia. This debt was payable by the company to the plaintiff, and recoverable by the plaintiff under and in pursuance of the provisions of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth). 4 The plaintiff served the statutory demand by posting it on 11 July 2006 by prepaid post to the registered office of the company in the ACT. The debt remained unpaid and on 31 October 2006, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings by originating application. The originating application complies with the statutory requirements of s 459Q of the Corporations Act . 5 Following the commencement of proceedings, the company supplied further information to the plaintiff. Amended assessments were issued for each period mentioned above, save the 2001 year. On or about 15 March 2007 notices of amended assessment of superannuation guarantee charges and additional charges for the years ended 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003 and the quarters ended 30 September 2003, 31 December 2003, 31 March 2004, 30 June 2004, 30 September 2004, 31 December 2004, 31 March 2005 and 30 June 2005 issued to the defendant. Between February and May 2007 the company made eight payments of \\$5,000 each and one payment of \\$6,200 for the total sum of \\$46,200.00. The amended assessments and instalment payments reduced the company's liability for superannuation guarantee charges, additional charges and penalties to \\$81,002.60, which remained outstanding as at 29 May 2007, when the hearing concluded. 6 As at that same date, the company had a running balance account deficit debt in the vicinity of \\$50,005.56.    The total liability owed by the defendant to the plaintiff is \\$131,008.16. 7 By virtue of s 75 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth) (\\\" Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act \\\"), the production of a notice of assessment is conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and that the amounts and particulars of the assessment are correct. The statutory framework 8 Part 5.4 of the Corporations Act governs winding up in insolvency. Section 459A provides that, on an application such as that which is the subject of these proceedings, \\\"the Court may order that an insolvent company be wound up in insolvency. \\\" Section 459C(2)(a) empowers the Court to presume that a company is insolvent if the company has failed to comply with a statutory demand. According to s 459F , a company is taken to have failed to comply with a statutory demand where it has not been complied with within 21 days from the date the demand is served. 9 While a company may apply to the Court to have a statutory demand set aside (s 459G(1)) , this must be done within the 21 day time limit described above. 10 Section 459S relevantly states: (1) In so far as an application for the company to be wound up in insolvency relies on a failure by the company to comply with a statutory demand, the company may not, without the leave of the Court, oppose the application on a ground: (a) that the company relied on for the purposes of an application by it for the demand to be set aside; or (b) that the company could have so relied on, but did not so rely on (whether it made such an application or not). (2) The Court is not to grant leave under subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that the ground is material to proving that the company is solvent. 11 Under s 465C a notice of grounds of opposition to an application for winding up, and an affidavit verifying the matters in the notice, are to be filed within the time prescribed by the rules, or leave is required to oppose. Leave to file an amended notice of opposition in this matter was granted by Registrar Hedge on 29 March 2007. 12 Finally, the Court has a general discretion under s 467 not to wind up a company \\\"even if a ground has been proved on which the Court may order the company to be wound up\\\". The defendant's case 13 In summary, the defendant submits that the present proceedings should be dismissed on the bases that: 1. There was no effective service of the statutory demand 2. There is \\\"no justiciable issue\\\" before the Court as the amended assessments displaced the initial assessments on which the statutory demand was based. 3. The defendant is solvent. 4. There is a genuine dispute about the debt.    5. Substantial injustice will be caused unless the demand is set aside; and 6. There are other reasons why the demand should be set aside. 14 With respect to the first ground above it is submitted by the defendant that the statutory demand was not properly served. Ms Gail Freeman, sole director of the defendant, deposed that she did not receive the statutory demand until 2 August 2006, which she believed to be after the date before which an application had to be made to have the demand set aside. 15 During the hearing the defendant pressed mainly the second ground. It was argued that, should this ground not be accepted, then the defendant would, in the alternative, seek leave, pursuant to s 459S of the Corporations Act , to raise grounds it could have raised in an application to set aside the statutory demand. The defendant submits that these proceedings should be struck out because the \\\"initial debts\\\" which underpin the statutory demand and which provided the \\\" raison d'etre \\\" for the current proceedings have been dissipated. Accordingly, there is said to be no longer any \\\"justiciable issue\\\" before the Court. 16 It is not in contention that the statutory demand which underpins the current proceedings relies upon the initial assessments that were issued prior to the current proceedings and which had a legal existence and effect prior to the plaintiff raising amended assessments on or about 15 March 2007. 17 According to the defendant the debt relating to the initial assessment raised for 2001 has been paid. Hence that part of the debt no longer represents any \\\"justiciable\\\" matter and the plaintiff cannot rely on that part of the debt in these proceedings. 18 As to the remaining debts which were the foundation of the statutory demand, the defendant submits that a fresh liability arises with respect to the defendant from the moment the plaintiff effected service of the notices of amended assessment. To support this contention the defendant relies on s 39 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act which provides: Amended assessment to be an assessment Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Act, an amended assessment is taken to be an assessment for all the purposes of this Act. 19 The defendant submits that it is manifest from the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act that the legal effect of the issuing of amended assessments is that the initial assessments become void ab initio and the debt raised pursuant to those initial assessments dissipates by operation of law. Consideration Service of the statutory demand 20 The formalities of serving a statutory notice of demand are set out in s 109X of the Corporations Act . Service by post to the registered office shown on the records maintained by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is effective service under s 109X(1) (a) (see for example FP Leonard Advertising v KD Travel Service Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACLC 1,203. ) 21 Section 29(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) is applicable to the service of statutory demands due to s 5C of the Corporations Act .    Section 29(1) deems postal service under s 109X(1)(a) to have been \\\"effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post\\\", after it has been sent in a properly addressed, prepaid and posted letter. As a result, a statutory demand is validly served if posted to the registered office of the company as at the date of posting, even though service is deemed not to be effected until a time after posting, namely when the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post. 22 By virtue of s 160 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) the statutory demand in the present case is presumed to have been served on Monday 17 July 2006, being the fourth working day after posting on Tuesday 11 July 2006. The defendant could have applied to set aside the demand in the period ending on Monday 7 August 2006. This was not done. 23 Further, no evidence has been submitted to warrant the presumption provided for in s 160 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) being called into doubt. 24 In my opinion there was proper and effective service of the statutory demand. \\\"No justiciable issue\\\" 25 As stated above, the defendant relied on what its counsel called a \\\"bifurcated argument\\\". The first part was that the debt which was the basis for the statutory demand does not now \\\"exist at law\\\" (the so-called \\\"no justiciable issue\\\" argument), and the second that the discretion of the Court should be exercised in its favour. 26 The first argument was said to be a stand-alone argument which, it was said, did not require the exercise of discretion under s 459S. It is true that such an argument is not one which the defendant could have relied on in an application to set aside the statutory demand (had one been made) because the amended assessments were issued after the deadline for making such an application. On one view, this may mean that they may not be proscribed by s 459S. Let it be assumed that that is so. Nevertheless, the arguments fail. 27 The defendant was unable to suggest any authority to the effect that, where the Commissioner founds a statutory demand on an assessment and there is a later assessment, the statutory demand is thereby invalidated. The defendant sought to rely on comments of Finkelstein J in NT Resorts Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 153 ALR 359. These do not suggest any support for the propositions argued. His Honour said, at 367: It may be open to argument that where the only debt that is specified in a statutory demand is a debt that is not due and payable then the demand is not a statutory demand at all. It is true that a statutory demand is defined by s 9 to include a demand that purports to be a demand. That is, a demand that professes or claims to be a statutory demand will be a statutory demand for the purposes of the Corporations Law: see Kalamunda [ Meat Wholesalers Pty Ltd v Reg Russell & Sons Pty Ltd (1994) 51 FCR 446 at] 452.    Nevertheless, there may be a case where a document that professes to be a statutory demand contains such a serious deficiency that it is impossible to treat the document as a statutory demand no matter what it professes to be: Topfelt [ Pty Ltd v State Bank of New South Wales Ltd (1993) 47 FCR 226 at] 238; Kalamunda at FCR 452. In this case it is not necessary to decide whether the demand is a statutory demand because it has not been established that the debts were not due and payable when the demand was served. 28 Setting aside the misplaced conception of \\\"justiciability\\\", the fact is that, at the time of service of the statutory demand, there were debts lawfully payable by the defendant to the plaintiff, as alleged in that demand. By independent operation of different statutory provisions there are now lawfully payable debts which the defendant cannot duly pay so as to compel a conclusion of insolvency. At no relevant time has the defendant ever been free of debt to the plaintiff at a level sufficient to enable resort by the plaintiff to the insolvency provisions of the Corporations Act . The statutory demand did not contain \\\"such a serious deficiency that it is impossible to treat the document as a statutory demand\\\" for the same reason as that given by Finkelstein J: it has not been shown that the debts in question \\\"were not due and payable when the demand was served \\\" (emphasis added). Leave to raise grounds of opposition under s 459S 29 With respect to grounds 4, 5 and 6 above, the defendant requires leave to raise these issues by virtue of s 459S of the Corporations Act . Leave is not to be granted unless the Court is satisfied that the grounds are material to the solvency of the company. The leave which may be granted under s 459S(1) is not leave to apply to set aside the statutory demand, but rather leave to oppose the application on a particular ground. If the ground of opposition is one which the company could have relied upon, but did not, in an application to set aside the demand, leave is required. 30 The scheme of Part 5.4 of the Corporations Act is to enable quick resolution of the issue of solvency and the determination of whether the company should be wound up, without the interposition of disputes about debts unless they are raised promptly ( David Grant & Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1995] HCA 43 ; (1995) 184 CLR 265 at 270). The Corporations Act provides that disputes about the existence of debts demanded in a statutory demand are to be resolved through the process of applying to set aside the statutory demand ( Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Paliflex Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 15 ; (1999) 17 ACLC 467 at [38] ). 31 The exercise of the discretion under s 459S(1) does not lead to the setting aside of the statutory demand, and therefore does not remove the presumption of insolvency which arises under s 459C(2)(a). If the Court grants leave, its task is to deal with the proceedings for winding up, rather than cutting away the demand which is their substratum.    The overall question of solvency is the critical issue (see, for example, D.A.G. International Pty Ltd v D.A.G. International Group Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1036 at [5] per Brereton J). 32 In my opinion, the grounds sought to be relied upon by the respondent are those which could have been relied on in application to set aside the statutory demand. As such, for these arguments to be raised the Court must be satisfied that they are material to the present solvency of the defendant company. For the reasons set out in [28] and [35], it has not been demonstrated by the defendant that these grounds are relevant to the solvency of the company. 33 Leave to raise the grounds listed above is refused. The solvency of the defendant 34 The presumption of insolvency raised by s 459C of the Corporations Act can be rebutted by positive proof of the company's solvency under s 459C(3). The company is required to prove, to the requisite civil standard, that it is able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable. No leave is required to oppose the winding up on this ground. 35 Prior to the hearing, the defendant put on some evidence of its current assets and liabilities. These figures were contained in the form of a balance sheet and admitted a current deficit of approximately \\$64,000. After the first day's hearing I adjourned the matter for several weeks to allow the defendant to put on further evidence regarding solvency and in support of its request that I exercise the discretion allowed by s 459S (discussed above). No evidence was submitted with respect to the discretion. A further affidavit sworn by Ms Freeman on 28 May 2007 annexed a \\\"schedule of financial records\\\" to demonstrate solvency. However, these records, rather than demonstrating solvency, confirm that the defendant is unable to meet the debt presently owed to the plaintiff. 36 The evidence which has been adduced on this point is insufficient to rebut the s 459C presumption. I am not satisfied that the company is not insolvent. General discretion not to order that company be wound up 37 The Court has a discretion under s 467 not to wind up a company \\\"even if a ground has been proved on which the Court may order the company to be wound up\\\". For example, it may, in appropriate circumstances, be better for creditors as a whole to allow the company to trade on rather than have the company wound up. The Court has a duty when considering whether to make a winding up order to have regard not only to the interests of the applicant creditor, but to the interests of all creditors: Re Presha Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd (1983) 1 ACLC 675 at 677. 38 No evidence was put forward regarding the position of unsecured creditors other than the plaintiff.    The National Australia Bank is a secured creditor. In the absence of such evidence, it cannot be said that it is against the interest of any creditors that the defendant be wound up in insolvency. 39 There was a plea of hardship as to Ms Freeman's personal position. That the company might be wound up is a sad affair for her and she has had some unfortunate and affecting distractions, not of her making. Nevertheless, over a period of years she has been the controller of the company and has permitted it to slip into its insolvency. There is no proven prospect that that state can tolerably quickly be cured. 40 In any event Ms Freeman is not the company. If people choose to trade through the means of an independent, corporate, legal entity, what may be a hardship or misfortune for them, which a court might be anxious to relieve, is not the hardship or misfortune of the corporate entity. 41 It was also put that a process was underway, albeit belatedly, whereby initial assessments by the plaintiff were being reduced as further information was supplied by the defendant. It is true that the defendant has succeeded in having the initial assessments reduced by providing additional information. There are avenues, namely appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal already in prospect whereby, theoretically, that process might continue. However there is no evidence to suggest that the intended appeals would bear fruit. Moreover the company has had more than ample time to investigate and produce the necessary information. No basis is shown for discretionary refusal of the relief claimed. 42 Nor does the adventitious fact that the assessments that founded the debt justifying the statutory demand have been superseded by other assessments, which in turn support a conclusion of insolvency, justify the Court in intervening on discretionary grounds in favour of the defendant. 43 The application is allowed with costs. I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Madgwick.

Regulation 1.24 in that division requires statutory declarations to be provided in respect of certain evidence. 2 Regulation 1.21 in Div 1.5 relevantly provides: ' (1) In this Division: ... statutory declaration means a statutory declaration under the Statutory Declarations Act 1959 ' ('the 1.21 definition'). This is a reference to an Act of the Commonwealth, the Statutory Declarations Act 1959 (Cth) ('the Commonwealth Act'). 3 The appellant, an Egyptian national, applied for a Partner (Migrant) (Class BC) visa ('the visa') on the basis of his marriage to an Australian citizen. The relationship broke down and the appellant made claims of domestic violence suffered at the hands of the sponsor and her family. A delegate of the Minister concluded that the appellant had not established that he suffered domestic violence because the requirements of Div 1.5 were not satisfied. It followed that he had not met the requirements for a grant of the visa. On review of that decision, the Migration Review Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had been in a genuine domestic relationship with the sponsor. It also concluded that the appellant did not meet the requirements of the Regulations in relation to domestic violence. The Tribunal affirmed the Delegate's decision. 4 At each stage, the appellant provided statutory declarations, purportedly in accordance with the Regulations. They were apparently made in accordance with Victorian legislation. The appellant accepts that the statutory declarations before the Tribunal and before the Delegate were not in accordance with the form prescribed by the Commonwealth Act. 5 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. The Minister conceded that the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error in relation to its conclusion that there was no genuine domestic relationship between the appellant and the sponsor. However, O'Dwyer FM found that the appellant had not satisfied the requirements of the Regulations because he had not provided a statutory declaration in the form prescribed by the Commonwealth Act ( Mohamed v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2007] FMCA 30 at [25] ) and dismissed the application. 6 The appellant appears by Counsel and the parties agree that the sole issue in this appeal from the Federal Magistrate's decision is whether the 1.21 definition    encompasses only a statutory declaration in the manner and form required by the Commonwealth Act ('a Commonwealth declaration') or whether a statutory declaration in some other form and made under a State Act ('a State declaration') is also a statutory declaration for the purposes of Div 1.5 of the Regulations. Consideration The Commonwealth Act 7 Section 7 of the Commonwealth Act provides: ' Where, in a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory (whether passed or made before or after the commencement of this Act), a reference is made to a statutory declaration, the reference includes a reference to a statutory declaration made under this Act, unless the contrary intention appears in that law. ' 8 Section 8 of the Commonwealth Act provides: ' A statutory declaration made under this Act must: (a) be in the prescribed form; and (b) be made before a prescribed person. ' 9 Section 7 of the Commonwealth Act does not preclude the use of a declaration made under a State Act ('a State declaration'). It renders it unnecessary to define the words \\\"statutory declaration\\\" in a law of the Commonwealth or a Territory specifically to include a declaration made under the Commonwealth Act. Section 8 prescribes the \\\"mechanics\\\" of a statutory declaration made under the Commonwealth Act. Provision is made for the \\\"prescribed form\\\" under reg 3 of the Statutory Declarations Regulations 1993 (Cth). 10 By s 7 and s 8 of the Commonwealth Act, a Commonwealth declaration in the prescribed form is a statutory declaration for the purposes of the Regulations unless the contrary intention appears. The appellant does not suggest any such contrary intention. 11 The appellant draws a distinction between a statutory declaration \\\" made under\\\" the Commonwealth Act and a statutory declaration \\\"under\\\" the Commonwealth Act, the latter being prescribed by reg 1.21. The appellant argues that a \\\"statutory declaration\\\" in Div 1.5 is not confined to statutory declarations made under the Commonwealth Act and ought to be interpreted as including all statutory declarations sworn under any Act of a Parliament, provided that the declaration contains the information as required by the Regulations. He submits that a \\\"statutory declaration\\\" pursuant to reg 1.21 is not confined to a Commonwealth declaration as prescribed by s 8. The use of \\\"under\\\" rather than \\\"made under\\\" is said to enliven the whole of the Commonwealth Act, including s 7. That section, the appellant submits, is plainly inclusive and sufficiently broad to encompass a statutory declaration made in Victoria pursuant to Victorian legislation and intended to be used in a proceeding arising under Commonwealth legislation. 12 The appellant accepts that, if this is not the case, the Tribunal was bound by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') and the Regulations to affirm the decision of the Delegate and it would be futile to remit the matter to the Tribunal. 13 In the context of the Act and Div 1.5 of the Regulations, reg 1.21 refers to a statutory declaration \\\"under\\\", in the ordinary sense of ' in accordance with ' ( Macquarie    Dictionary , 4 th ed, 2005, 16) or ' pursuant to ' the Commonwealth Act ( Energy Resources of Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 52 ATR 120 at [37] per Lindgren J and the cases there cited), that is a s 8 statutory declaration. The fact that the expression used is \\\"under\\\" rather than \\\"made under\\\" does not mean that statutory declarations made in accordance with legislation other than the Commonwealth Act are or were intended to be included for the purposes of Div 1.5. The appellant contends that Parliament could have stated its intention more explicitly by referring in reg 1.21 to a statutory declaration \\\"made under\\\" or \\\"in a manner prescribed by\\\" the Commonwealth Act. That may be so but it does not mean that the intention was the opposite, to include State declarations. 14 The appellant submits that, if the intention were to specify only Commonwealth declarations in reg 1.21, the intention was not executed. I do not accept that this is so. A statutory declaration under or in accordance with the Commonwealth Act is a Commonwealth declaration which complies with s 8 of the Commonwealth Act. 15 Regulation 1.21 is a definition for the purposes of Div 1.5 of the Regulations, which relates to domestic violence. The effect of Div 1.5 is to institute a mechanical form of proof of domestic violence, a serious allegation, which absolves an applicant from the need to prove domestic violence in the ordinary course. It is therefore appropriate that every element of that mode of proof be satisfied ( Cakmak v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2005] FCA 503 at [40] per Gray J, not the subject of comment on dismissal of the appeal in Cakmak v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 257 ; (2003) 135 FCR 183). The specification of a Commonwealth declaration also absolves the decision-maker from having to ascertain whether a statutory declaration meets the requirements of the varied State laws. Perhaps, as a matter of less significance, a single form of declaration exposes a person making a statutory declaration to uniform penalties for a false declaration. 16 The appellant submits that a declaration sworn under State legislation is no less effective or efficacious than a declaration under the Commonwealth Act. In his submission, it has the same effect of imposing on the deponent an awareness of the consequences of a false declaration and the penalties for perjury. That may be the case for awareness but not necessarily for the consequences. 17 The parties referred the Court to reg 1.27 of the Regulations after the hearing, without further comment or submission. That regulation provides that a statutory declaration made under the relevant provisions of Div 1.5 is not admissible in evidence before a court or tribunal otherwise than in an application for judicial review or merits review of a decision to refuse to grant a visa or in a prosecution \\\"under section 11 of the Commonwealth Act\\\" for the making of a false declaration.    There is no reference in reg 1.27 to admissibility in prosecutions under relevant State legislation. If State declarations were intended to be included within the meaning of reg 1.21, such a reference would be expected. The Acts Interpretation Act 18 Section 27 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) relevantly provides: 'In any Act, unless the contrary intention appears: ... (c) The words \\\"statutory declaration\\\" shall mean a declaration made by virtue of any Act authorizing a declaration to be made otherwise than in the course of a judicial proceeding. ' 19 The Commonwealth Act is an act authorising a declaration to be made otherwise than in the course of a judicial proceeding (s 6(1) of the Commonwealth Act). 20 Neither party made submissions in reliance on s 27 of the Acts Interpretation Act . As with reg 1.27 of the Regulations, the parties referred the Court to the provision after the hearing, without submission or comment. 21 Section 27 applies to the words \\\"statutory declaration\\\" when used '[i] n any Act '. That includes the Regulations (s 13(1)(a) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (Cth)). Expressions used in the Regulations have the same meaning as those used in the enabling legislation (s 13(1)(b) of the Legislative Instruments Act ). If a State Act comes within \\\"any Act\\\" in s 27(c) (cf a reference to \\\"a State Act\\\" as envisaged by subs 38(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act ), \\\"statutory declaration\\\" when used in the Regulations would include a declaration made by virtue of a State Act, unless the contrary intention appears. On this basis, s 27 encompasses Commonwealth and State declarations. 22 There is no definition of \\\"statutory declaration\\\" in the Act to provide a contrary intention. There is, however, the 1.21 definition in the Regulations. There would be no purpose in defining \\\"statutory declaration\\\" in reg 1.21 merely to include a Commonwealth declaration because that has already been provided for by s 27 of the Acts Interpretation Act and s 7 of the Commonwealth Act ( Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [71] ). 23 Section 27 applies subject to a contrary intention. A contrary intention is evidenced by the 1.21 definition, which purports to exclude a State declaration. There is no other apparent reason for defining \\\"statutory declaration\\\" in reg 1.21. Accordingly, s 27 does not apply to \\\"statutory declaration\\\" in Div 1.5 to include a State declaration. Conclusion 24 For the purposes of Div 1.5 of the Regulations, it was necessary for the appellant to provide a Commonwealth declaration; that is, a statutory declaration in the form prescribed by the Commonwealth Act (s 8). He did not do so. The task of the Tribunal was to determine ' whether the evidence presented to it satisfie [d] the description called for in the delegated legislation ' ( Cakmak 132 FCR 183 at [52]    per the Full Court; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Ejueyitsi [2007] FCAFC 89 at [24] ). For the reasons given, the evidence did not satisfy that description. The Federal Magistrate was not in error in finding that the Tribunal had correctly concluded that the appellant had not satisfied the requirements of reg 1.24 of the Regulations in relation to his claims of domestic violence. I agree with Hill J in Morgan v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1059 at [11] that the fact that a declaration was not made under the Commonwealth Act but under a Victorian Act means that, were the matter to go back to the Tribunal, the Tribunal would have to find against the appellant for this reason. Such referral is, therefore, futile. 25 The appeal is dismissed. The appellant is to pay the Minister's costs.

I will call the applicant in proceeding NSD 1231 of 2005 \\\"Ceramics\\\" and the applicant in proceeding NSD 1232 of 2005 \\\"Fresta\\\". I will call the respondent in each proceeding \\\"the Commissioner\\\". 2 Each proceeding concerns assessments to income tax for the years ended 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2001. In respect of each applicant and each tax year, the Commissioner issued a notice of amended assessment on 31 March 2004, except in the case of Fresta for the year ended 30 June 2000, for which the Commissioner issued a notice of assessment on 31 March 2004. Each applicant objected on 23 July 2004. The Commissioner gave notice of his decisions on the objections on 23 May 2005. 3 The proceedings concern Div 7A of Pt III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (the Act). Div 7A expands the operation of s 44(1) of the Act. Section 44(1) provides that the assessable income of a shareholder in a company includes dividends paid to him by the company. The question that arises in the present case is whether Div 7A has the effect that payments made by Ceramics to Di Lorenzo Tile Investments Pty Limited (Tile) as trustee of a unit trust, the units in which were held as to three by Ceramics and as to the remaining one by Fresta, were to be treated as dividends paid to the respective unitholders (deemed dividends), Ceramics and Fresta respectively. DRAMATIS PERSONAE AND GENERAL BACKGROUND 4 Gioacchino Di Lorenzo was born in Italy on 12 June 1941, came to Australia in 1963, and is an Australian citizen. In Australia, he is called \\\"Jack\\\" Di Lorenzo. His wife is Salvatora (Sally) Di Lorenzo. They have four daughters: Maria, Pietrina, Diana and Belinda. Maria is Maria Fresta, the wife of Rafael Fresta. Pietrina is married to Hristos (Chris) Rogaris, and Diana's partner is Davide Isola. Belinda is a university student. 5 Mr Di Lorenzo described his education in Italy as being \\\"up to Australian Year 10 equivalent\\\". It is clear that by dent of hard work and enterprise, he has built up a substantial business of supplying and fixing tiles, of which he is justly proud. 6 Until 1978 Mr Di Lorenzo had been in employment.    At that time he suffered a heart attack and decided to commence business on his own account. In 1982 he established a company, Vispoka Pty Ltd (it was incorporated on 21 June 1982), which, in 1996, changed its name to \\\"Di Lorenzo Ceramics Pty Ltd\\\". There was a further change in the company's name in 2005 to \\\"Di Lorenzo Pty Ltd\\\", but it is still appropriate to refer to it as \\\"Ceramics\\\". At all times, Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo have been the only directors and shareholders of Ceramics. 7 In 1984, Ceramics commenced its present business. Its clientele includes major developers and the public. Mr Di Lorenzo's four daughters have worked in the family business, in Belinda's case on a part-time basis on account of her university studies. Mr and Mrs Fresta have been heavily involved in the business. Mr Di Lorenzo describes Mrs Fresta as \\\"the financial controller\\\" and Mr Fresta as \\\"the general manager\\\". 8 From 1984 to October 2002, Ceramics conducted its business out of premises at Blacktown --- from 1984 to 1992 out of leased premises, and from 1992 out of premises it purchased. 9 The dispute with which the present proceedings are concerned arises out of the next expansion in the Di Lorenzo business. This took the form of the acquisition of a 9,500 square metre block of land at 13-15 Lexington Drive, Norwest Business Park, Baulkham Hills (the Norwest site), and the subsequent construction of a building on it. The purchase was completed on 30 June 2000. The construction of the building was completed in September 2002. In October 2002, the business was relocated to the new building. 10 Mrs Fresta is a qualified chartered accountant and a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. According to her affidavit, she left employment with Ernst & Young in 1993 and joined the family's business as the internal accountant for Ceramics. According to Mr Di Lorenzo's affidavit, from about 1996, when he underwent heart surgery, Mr and Mrs Fresta have worked in the family business. It may be that 1993 is the correct year for Mrs Fresta and 1996 the correct one for her husband. 11 The external accountants and tax agents of the business are LCI Partners Pty Ltd (LCI). The letters \\\"L\\\", \\\"C\\\" and \\\"I\\\" apparently stand for the surnames of Sergio P Laureti, Frank Cavasinni and Gerry Incollingo, who are three of the directors of the incorporated practice. Mr Incollingo is the person at the firm who was most heavily involved in the dealings to be discussed.    12 In 1999, Mr Di Lorenzo considered that there was an opportunity to expand the business of Ceramics into Baulkham Hills, where much residential property development was occurring. He negotiated a price of \\$1.9 million for the Norwest site. A quantity surveyor advised him that the cost of building suitable premises would be in the order of \\$3 million, although this proved to be an underestimate. According to these figures, some \\$4.9 million would be needed. The ANZ Bank (ANZ) agreed to provide finance. There are different versions of the lending arrangements proposed but there are various possible explanations for any discrepancies, which are, in any event, of no consequence. Mrs Fresta states that ANZ agreed to lend \\$4.4 million. Mr Di Lorenzo says that it agreed to lend \\$1.7 million towards the purchase and \\$2 million towards the construction (a total of \\$3.7 million). Mr Di Lorenzo states that ANZ insisted that he find an equity contribution of some \\$700,000 immediately, comprising approximately \\$200,000 for the deposit and expenses on the purchase of the land, and \\$500,000 towards construction. 13 ANZ also required security. In addition to guarantees and securities provided by Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo, Mr and Mrs Fresta agreed to provide a guarantee secured by a first mortgage over their home. Mrs Fresta states that she and her husband were the only members of the family who were able to assist in this way at the time because her younger sisters were in circumstances that did not permit them to do so. 14 Mr Di Lorenzo and Mrs Fresta discussed with Mr Incollingo the most desirable way of structuring the acquisition and construction, and it was decided that a unit trust structure be used, the trustee company being a new company to be formed, the units in the trust being held as to three quarters by Ceramics and one quarter by a company to be formed for Mr and Mrs Fresta. The premises were to be leased by Ceramics from the trustee of the unit trust. 15 Accordingly, Mr Incollingo caused Tile and Fresta to be incorporated on 25 August 1999, and by Deed dated 27 September 1999, the Di Lorenzo Property Group Unit Trust (the Unit Trust) to be constituted with Tile as trustee and a capital of \\$4.00 divided into four units, held as to three by Ceramics and as to one by Fresta. 16 Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo have always been the only directors and shareholders of Tile, and Mr and Mrs Fresta the only directors and shareholders of Fresta. 17 According to a letter from ANZ dated 17 May 2000, ANZ offered two facilities of \\$1.7 million and \\$2 million to Tile and five facilities totalling \\$1,115,000 to Ceramics, a grand total of \\$4,815,000. 18 The solicitors who acted for Tile on the purchase were MatthewsFolbigg and the persons of that firm who were involved were Paul Matthews and Danuta Harkin. 19 The MatthewsFolbigg \\\"Purchaser Settlement Sheet\\\" dated 30 June 2000 shows that on settlement ANZ advanced \\$1,694,456.17.    The deposit that had been paid was \\$190,000, and the solicitors asked Tile to provide by way of bank cheque a remaining balance of \\$33,157.87. In substance then, ANZ advanced to Tile \\$1,694,456.17, and a further \\$223,157.87 came from within the Di Lorenzo family. In fact those monies and all others that were provided from the Di Lorenzo family group towards the purchase and construction, came from Ceramics and were paid out of its bank account. A bank account was never opened for Tile. 20 Tile entered into a building contract with State Developments Pty Ltd dated 11 September 2000 for the construction of the building for an estimated price of \\$3,300,000. 21 On 1 October 2001 Tile granted a lease of the building to Ceramics at a rental of \\$55,000 per month commencing on that date. 22 Other companies, trusts and superannuation funds have been involved in the Di Lorenzo family group. These, however, are not relevant to the issues before the Court. LEGISLATION 23 Prior to the introduction of Div 7A, s 108 of the Act was an anti- avoidance provision intended to prevent private companies from distributing profits to shareholders and their associates tax free in the form of loans or other payments. Generally speaking, s 108 also operated to capture amounts paid or credited to a shareholder or a person associated with a shareholder, deeming such amounts to be dividends, which would therefore be included in assessable income of the recipient under s 44(1) of the Act. The deemed dividend was not, however, subject to dividend withholding tax and was unfrankable (that is, could not carry imputation credits to allow a rebate to the recipients for tax paid by the company). 24 Importantly, however, s 108 operated only when the Commissioner formed the opinion that the amount lent or paid represented a distribution of profits. In order to be in a position to form that opinion, the Commissioner needed to consider many factors and to analyse much information, which usually would not be available unless the Commissioner conducted an audit. It was believed that many amounts paid or credited that should have been assessed as dividend income were escaping taxation. 25 Division 7A was introduced by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No 3) 1998 (Cth). In the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill for the amending Act, it was explained that the new measures would operate automatically rather than depend on the formation of an opinion by the Commissioner. 26 On the Second Reading Speech for the Bill, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Hon Rod Kemp, stated: The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is being amended to ensure that payments and loans made by a private company to a shareholder or a shareholder's associate are treated as assessable dividends to the extent that there are realised or unrealised profits in the company.    Generally speaking, the amendments applied from 4 December 1997, the date of their introduction into the Parliament. Section 109B , the first section within Div 7A, explained that the Division treated three kinds of amounts as dividends paid by a private company: • amounts paid by the company to a shareholder or shareholder's associate (s 109C) ; • amounts lent by the company to a shareholder or shareholder's associate (ss 109D , 109E ); • amounts of debts owed by a shareholder or shareholder's associate to the company that the company forgave (s 109F). 27 The amounts were made assessable income of the shareholder or associate (under s 44(1) , noted earlier) and provided a basis for reducing the company's franking account credit (under s 160AQCNC). 28 Some payments, loans and forgivings of debts were not treated as dividends (Subdivs C and D). Two of the provisions in Subdiv D have featured in this case. First, s 109J provided: A private company is not taken under section 109C to pay a dividend because of the payment of an amount, to the extent that the payment: (a) discharges an obligation of the private company to pay money to the entity; and (b) is not more than would have been required to discharge the obligation had the private company and entity been dealing with each other at arm's length. Accordingly, if Ceramics purchased property from Tile and thereby incurred an obligation to pay Tile the purchase price, and if that price was no more than the price the parties would have agreed upon if they had been dealing with each other at arm's length, s 109C would not deem the payment to be a dividend. I note that it has not been suggested before me that the rental paid by Ceramics to Tile pursuant to Ceramics' obligations as lessee is a deemed dividend under s 109C: no doubt the view has been taken that the amount of the rent is no more than that which Tile and Ceramics would have agreed upon if they had been dealing with each other at arm's length. 29 The second noteworthy provision in Subdiv D is s 109K , which provided: A private company is not taken under section 109C or 109D to pay a dividend because of a payment or loan the private company makes to another company. Note: This does not apply to a payment or loan to a company in its capacity as trustee. (See section 109ZE. ) I discuss this provision at [95] --- [98] below. 30 An amount was to be treated as a dividend even if it was paid or lent by the company to the shareholder or associate through one or more interposed entities (Subdiv E). If the total of the amounts of the deemed dividends exceeded the company's distributable surplus, only that part of the total equal to the distributable surplus was treated as dividend (s 109Y). 31 In the present case, \\\"the company\\\" is Ceramics and the shareholders in it are Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo. The Commissioner's case is that: • Ceramics made loans to Tile by reason of the payments it made in discharge of Tile's liabilities in connection with the purchase    and construction; • by reason of the fact that Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo were the only shareholders in Ceramics and Tile, and of the statutory definition of \\\"associate\\\", Tile was an associate of the shareholders in Ceramics; and • in their capacity as unitholders, Ceramics and Fresta were presently entitled to the income consisting of the deemed dividends, as to three quarters in the case of Ceramics and as to one quarter in the case of Fresta. 32 Sections 109C and 109D provided as follows: 109C Payments treated as dividends When private company is taken to pay a dividend (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of the private company's year of income if the private company pays an amount to the entity during the year and either: (a) the payment is made when the entity is a shareholder in the private company or an associate of such a shareholder; or (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the payment is made because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time. Note 1: Some payments do not give rise to dividends. See Subdivision D. Note 2: A private company is treated as making a payment to a shareholder or shareholder's associate if an interposed entity makes a payment to the shareholder or associate. See Subdivision E. Amount of dividend (2) The dividend is taken to equal the amount paid, subject to section 109Y. Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division to the company's distributable surplus. What is a payment to an entity? (3) In this Division, payment to an entity means: (a) a payment to the extent that it is to the entity, on behalf of the entity or for the benefit of the entity; and (b) a credit of an amount to the extent that it is: (i) to the entity; or (ii) on behalf of the entity; or (iii) for the benefit of the entity; and (c) a transfer of property to the entity. Loans are not payments (3A) However, a loan to an entity is not a payment to the entity. Value of payment by transfer of property (4) The amount of a payment consisting of a transfer of property is the amount that would have been paid for the transfer by parties dealing at arm's length less any consideration given by the transferee for the transfer. (The amount of a payment is nil if the consideration given by the transferee equals or exceeds the amount that would have been paid at arm's length for the transfer. ) 109D Loans treated as dividends Loans treated as dividends in year of making (1) A private company is taken to pay a dividend to an entity at the end of one of the private company's years of income (the current year ) if: (a) the private company makes a loan to the entity during the current year; and (b) the loan is not fully repaid by the end of the current year; and (c) Subdivision D does not prevent the private company from being taken to pay a dividend because of the loan at the end of the current year; and (d) either: (i) the entity is a shareholder in the private company, or an associate of such a shareholder, when the loan is made; or (ii) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the loan is made because the entity has been such a shareholder or associate at some time.    Note 1: Some repayments cannot be counted for the purpose of this subsection. See section 109R. Note 2: A private company is treated as making a loan to a shareholder or shareholder's associate if an interposed entity makes a loan to the shareholder or associate. See Subdivision E. Loans treated as dividends in year following that of making (1A) ... Amount of dividend (2) The amount of the dividend taken to have been paid is the amount of the loan that has not been repaid at the end of the current year, subject to section 109Y. Note: Section 109Y limits the total amount of dividends taken to have been paid by a private company under this Division to the company's distributable surplus. What is a loan? (3) In this Division, loan includes: (a) an advance of money; and (b) a provision of credit or any other form of financial accommodation; and (c) a payment of an amount for, on account of, on behalf of or at the request of, an entity, if there is an express or implied obligation to repay the amount; and (d) a transaction (whatever its terms or form) which in substance effects a loan of money. In which year of income is a loan made? (4) ... Loans made before 4 December 1997 (5) ... It will be noted that by reason of s 109C(3A) , payments and loans are dealt with in a mutually exclusive manner in ss 109C and 109D respectively. 33 Section 109Z provided: If a private company is taken under this Division to have paid a dividend to an entity, the dividend is taken for the purposes of this Act to be paid: (a) to the entity as a shareholder in the private company; and (b) out of the private company's profits. Accordingly, if, as the Commissioner contends, Ceramics is taken to have paid a dividend to Tile, the dividend is taken to have been paid to Tile as a shareholder in Ceramics. 34 Section 109ZD provided that in Div 7A, \\\"associate\\\" had the meaning given by s 318 of the Act, \\\"entity\\\" had the meaning given by s 960-100 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (the 1997 Act), and \\\"loan\\\" and \\\"payment\\\" had the respective meanings given by ss 109D(3) and 109C(3) of the Act. 35 Not only did s 109ZD, as noted above, provide that in Div 7A \\\"entity\\\" had the meaning given by s 960-100 of the 1997 Act: in addition, s 109ZE provided that the rules in s 960-100 of the 1997 Act about entities apply to Div 7A. Section 960-100 of the 1997 Act provided as follows: (1) Entity means any of the following: (a) an individual; (b) a body corporate; (c) a body politic; (d) a partnership; (e) any other unincorporated association or body of persons; (f) a trust; (g) a superannuation fund. Note: The term entity is used in a number of different but related senses. It covers all kinds of legal person. It also covers groups of legal persons, and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate identity in the same way as a legal person does.    (1A) ... (2) The trustee of a trust or of a superannuation fund is taken to be an entity consisting of the person who is the trustee, or the persons who are the trustees, at any given time. Note: This is because a right or obligation cannot be conferred or imposed on an entity that is not a legal person. (3) A legal person can have a number of different capacities in which the person does things. In each of those capacities, the person is taken to be a different entity . Example: In addition to his or her personal capacity, an individual may be: sole trustee of one or more trusts; and one of a number of trustees of a further trust. In his or her personal capacity, he or she is one entity. As trustee of each trust, he or she is a different entity. The trustees of the further trust are a different entity again, of which the individual is a member. (4) If a provision refers to an entity of a particular kind, it refers to the entity in its capacity as that kind of entity, not to that entity in any other capacity. Example: A provision that refers to a company does not cover a company in a capacity as trustee, unless it also refers to a trustee. Note: Under section 87-35, certain parts of Australian governments and authorities are treated as separate entities for the purposes of ascertaining whether another entity is conducting a personal services business. It is to be noted that s 2-45 of the 1997 Act provided that notes and examples formed part of that Act, although they were distinguished from the operative provisions in their typeface. 36 Section 318 of the Act provided, relevantly, as follows: (1) For the purposes of this Part [Pt X], the following are associates of an entity (in this subsection called the primary entity ) that is a natural person (otherwise than in the capacity of trustee): ... (d) a trustee of a trust where the primary entity, or another entity that is an associate of the primary entity because of another paragraph of this subsection, benefits under the trust; (e) a company where: (i) ... (ii) a majority voting interest in the company is held by: (A) the primary entity; ... It was not argued that Tile was not an associate of Ceramics under these provisions. Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo are the shareholders in Ceramics: see ss 109C(1) and 109D(1) above. If we treat Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo as the \\\"primary entity\\\" referred to in subs (1) of s 318, Tile falls within para (d) of that subsection because it is a trustee of a trust where another entity that is an associate of Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo, namely, Ceramics, benefits under the trust. Ceramics is an associate of Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo because it is a company where a majority voting interest in it is held by Mr and Mrs Di Lorenzo within s 318(1)(e). 37 I will note further provisions of the Act, notably ss 45Z and 46, which have been referred to in submissions, in the discussion at [113] --- [117] below. A FACTUAL DISPUTE --- WAS THERE A LOAN BY CERAMICS TO TILE?    38 The only significant factual dispute in the case concerns whether Ceramics lent to Tile the monies that Tile needed to purchase the land and to construct the building, other than the monies that Tile borrowed from ANZ. The Commissioner contends that Ceramics did so and that in consequence s 109D of the Act (loans) applied. The applicants contend that Ceramics did not do so and that as between s 109C (payments) and s 109D (loans) it is s 109C that falls to be considered. They submit, however, that s 109C is not enlivened in any event. Moreover, they submit that the factual dispute (as to whether there was a loan from Ceramics to Tile) \\\"is largely an irrelevant distraction because ... the threshold legal issue is the same whether a private company [Ceramics] pays money to a trustee [Tile] for itself [Ceramics] or lends money to the trust [Tile] for itself [Ceramics]\\\". 39 It was only very late in the day that the applicants came to contend that the monies that Ceramics paid to Tile were not loans. In his evidence, Mr Di Lorenzo insisted that he left everything to Mr Incollingo to set up. He said that his only intention was that his four daughters should share in all that he had to leave them in four equal shares, but with Mrs Fresta receiving her one quarter immediately in view of the fact that she and her husband had provided their personal guarantees and the mortgage over their home. Mrs Fresta's evidence was generally to the same effect. So was that of Mr Incollingo. In her affidavit, Mrs Fresta said: \\\"It was always understood that I was not to attain any extra benefits, but that I was just getting this benefit earlier. \\\" The accountants, Mrs Fresta and Mr Incollingo, said that the numerous references to a \\\"loan\\\" revealed in the documentary and other evidence before the Court did not adequately reflect the parties' intention. 40 Andrew Farrugia, a Technical Officer in the Small Medium Enterprises business line at the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) at Parramatta, made an affidavit that recounted in chronological sequence the contacts between the ATO and the Di Lorenzo family or LCI on its behalf. 41 Mr Farrugia had the conduct of a comprehensive review on behalf of the Commissioner in relation to the tax affairs of Ceramics in respect of the years of income ended 30 June 2000, 2001 and 2002. As a result of issues that emerged during the course of the review, he subsequently conducted an audit of Ceramics. 42 On 14 April 2003, the ATO wrote to Mr Di Lorenzo advising that it was conducting a review of the tax affairs of Ceramics. The letter asked him to provide certain information for the three years mentioned, including a statement of financial performance and a statement of financial position. 43 On 6 May 2003, Mr Laureti of LCI forwarded to the ATO balance sheets and profit and loss accounts as at, and for the years ended, 30 June 2000, 2001 and 2002. A covering statement was to the effect that the directors of Ceramics had provided the financial information that formed the basis of the financial statements.    44 The respective balance sheets showed as a current asset of Ceramics a loan to the Unit Trust as follows: 30 June 2000 30 June 2001 30 June 2002 \\$384,218.28 \\$841,704.87 \\$778,982.62 It will be recalled that the year ended 30 June 2000 was the year in which Tile and Fresta were incorporated and the Unit Trust established. 45 On 16 May 2003, Mr Farrugia attended the premises of LCI at Church Street Parramatta, where he met with Mr Di Lorenzo. Mr Fresta and Mr Incollingo were also present. Either Mr Di Lorenzo or Mr Fresta said that the books of account were prepared by Mr Di Lorenzo's daughters. Mr Farrugia asked questions concerning the \\\"loans\\\", and Mr Incollingo said that the loan recorded in the balance sheet related to the deposit cheque for the Norwest site that was paid for by the Unit Trust from funds provided by Ceramics. He said \\\"there are no loan agreements in respect of both loans and no interest has been charged on either. The loans will be paid back. \\\" 46 In cross-examination, while not denying the accuracy of Mr Farrugia's contemporaneous notes, to the above effect, Mr Incollingo said that he could not recall stating that the loans were to be paid back. 47 According to his affidavit, Mr Farrugia said to those present that where a loan is made by a company to a trustee company there may be \\\"Division 7A implications in relation to the loan to the Unit Trust\\\", but Mr Incollingo replied that he thought there was no problem as there had been no distribution by the Unit Trust. He undertook to give Mr Farrugia details of the Unit Trust and of the trustee company. 48 It is significant that Mr Incollingo's response was not to say that the reference to \\\"loan\\\" had been a mistake, but that a loan presented no difficulty because there had been no distribution to the unitholders. 49 On 21 May 2003, there was a telephone conversation between Mr Farrugia and Mr Incollingo in which Mr Farrugia again referred to the loan to the Unit Trust as being \\\"a major issue which [would] require further discussions\\\". Mr Farrugia undertook to fax a letter to Mr Incollingo outlining the tax issues to be discussed at a meeting that was scheduled for 28 May 2003. 50 On 22 May 2003, Mr Farrugia wrote to Mr Di Lorenzo care of Mr Incollingo seeking further particulars of the loan and other information, and asking that the information and documentation requested be provided at the meeting scheduled for 27 May 2003 (apparently there had been a change from 28 May 2003 or the earlier reference to that date had been an error). 51 On 27 May 2003, at the offices of LCI, Mr Incollingo said that he thought the loan was to the Unit Trust and could be classed as an investment with the consequence that Division 7A did not apply. According to Mr Farrugia, during the interview he was handed a two page response to his letter of 22 May 2003 and a copy of the Unit Trust balance sheets as at 30 June 2000 and 2002.    52 The two page document stated under the heading \\\"Loan to Di Lorenzo Property Group Trust\\\", \\\"[t]his loan originated in October 1999 with the purchase of the property at Lot 7071 Lexington Drive Norwest Business Park, Bella Vista\\\". In cross-examination Mr Incollingo questioned whether he would have given such a two page document to Mr Farrugia because it was not on LCI's letterhead. He insisted that virtually all documents that go out of LCI's office go out on the firm's letterhead. He said, however, that he did not mean to suggest that Mr Farrugia's evidence was false. I note that Mr Farrugia's letter of 22 May 2003 had requested 13 classes of particulars, and that the two page document responded in 13 corresponding paragraphs. I find that the two page document was prepared by or under the direction of Mr Incollingo and that he or someone under his direction handed it to Mr Farrugia in the course of the meeting. 53 Indeed, I note more generally that I accept Mr Farrugia's evidence of his dealings with Mr Incollingo, to which there was, in any event, no serious challenge. He made contemporaneous handwritten notes of the conversations to which he was a party and annexed them to his affidavit. 54 The balance sheet that was handed to Mr Farrugia at the meeting on 27 May 2003 showed that as at 30 June 2000, the Unit Trust had a current liability in the form of a loan made by Ceramics of \\$384,218.28, and the balance sheet of the Unit Trust as at 30 June 2002 showed a comparable figure of \\$778,982.62. These figures were, of course, the amounts shown in the balance sheets as at 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2002 of Ceramics as assets of that company (see [44] above). 55 On 28 May 2003, Mr Farrugia told Mr Incollingo that he had meant to get a copy of \\\"the Loan Account\\\" at the meeting on the preceding day but had omitted to do so, and Mr Incollingo said that he would fax to Mr Farrugia \\\"a copy of the Loan Account\\\". On the same day, 28 May 2003, Mr Incollingo faxed to Mr Farrugia what his covering memo described as \\\"Ledger printout for the loan to Di Lorenzo Property Group Unit Trust for the three years from 2000 to 2002\\\". That document was headed \\\"Di Lorenzo Ceramics Pty Ltd --- Annual General Ledger\\\". The first item under the heading \\\"Narration\\\" was \\\"Loan --- Di Lorenzo Property Group Unit Trust\\\". Apart from an opening balance of Nil, the first entry was dated 31 October 1999 and was a debit of \\$190,000. I infer that this was the amount of the deposit that Ceramics had paid on account of Tile towards the purchase of the Norwest site. 56 The Annual General Ledger, to the extent that it was provided, covered the period from 31 October 1999 to 30 June 2002. It contained references to numerous payments connected with the purchase of the Norwest site and the construction of the building. For the year ended 30 June 2000, the debit entries totalled \\$384,218.28 (see [44] above).    There were no credits to Tile's loan account with Ceramics for that year. For the year ended 30 June 2001 there were many debit and credit entries, leaving a debit balance at that date of \\$841,704.87 (see [44] above). (Since the Commissioner treated the payments by Ceramics as loans to Tile, he similarly treated the amounts credited to Tile's loan account as repayments, and only the debit balance of \\$841,704.87 at 30 June 2001 as the amount of the deemed dividend --- see s 109D(2) of the Act. ) 57 Mr Incollingo also provided to Mr Farrugia a copy of the Unit Trust Deed. 58 On 3 June 2003, Mr Farrugia telephoned LCI and spoke to Anna Forcella, an employee, stating that the main issue of concern to the ATO was \\\"the loan to the Unit Trust\\\". He arranged a further meeting for 12 June 2003 with Messrs Incollingo and Di Lorenzo. 59 That meeting took place and Mr Laureti joined the discussion towards the end of the meeting. Mr Farrugia said that the ATO view was that the loan represented a deemed dividend under Div 7A. Mr Laureti said that he disagreed because he could not see how the loan could be deemed to be a dividend. He said: \\\"Who are the recipients of the deemed dividend given that the unitholders are the companies?\\\". Mr Farrugia replied that under the legislation the shareholders and/or their associates were deemed to be the recipients and, in the present case, that would be the unitholders (in and since his decision on the applicants' objections, the Commissioner has treated Tile as the recipient of the deemed dividend). 60 On 30 June 2003, Mr Farrugia told Mr Incollingo that it had been decided to finalise the \\\"review\\\" and to commence an \\\"audit\\\". He indicated that a matter to be included in the audit was the loan to the Unit Trust. On the same day, he wrote to Ceramics care of LCI confirming the commencement of the audit of the company covering, inter alia, the issue concerning the loan to the Unit Trust. 61 On 5 August 2003, Mr Farrugia attended the office of LCI and spoke to Mr Incollingo in relation to \\\"the loan account\\\" that he had sent to Mr Farrugia, asking for the source of the credits that were allocated to the loan account. Mr Incollingo said \\\"these figures relate to draw-downs from the ANZ loan and rent paid by Di Lorenzo Ceramics to the property trust\\\". Mr Farrugia asked for \\\"a copy of the loan account with full narrations\\\". 62 On 7 August 2003, LCI forwarded to Mr Farrugia a copy of Ceramics' General Ledger Account 697 (Loans to Di Lorenzo Group Property Unit Trust) for the year ended 30 June 2001, with, according to the covering memo, \\\"narrations of all credit amounts\\\". 63 On 12 September 2003, Mr Farrugia attended the premises of LCI where he met with Messrs Incollingo and Laureti. He said that the ATO was still of the view that the loan gave rise to a deemed dividend to the unitholders, as the trustee company, Tile, was an associate of the company    (Ceramics) that had provided the loan, and the legislation did not exclude a loan by a company to another company in its capacity as trustee. According to Mr Farrugia's affidavit, Mr Laureti stated: A loan was not provided because the money should have been treated as an investment. We are going to organise for amended balance sheets to be prepared to change the loan to an investment. Mr Farrugia said that an amended balance sheet alone would not be sufficient. He asked for a submission to support the contention that the monies \\\"are now an investment\\\". 64 On 17 September 2003, LCI wrote a lengthy letter to Mr Farrugia stating that there had been no intention for the monies advanced ever to be repaid, but that there was an intention to receive a return on an investment, whether it be in the form of capital or revenue.  The letter asserted that the client did not \\\"fit into the parameters of the legislation because the monies subscribed for shares were not a loan but an investment in which they will enjoy a rate of return\\\". RESOLUTION OF THE FACTUAL DISPUTE 65 Ceramics' Annual General Ledger included, in addition to numerous debit entries for payments made by Ceramics in discharge of liabilities of Tile, credit entries being amounts that came in from ANZ to Tile, BAS refunds to which Tile was entitled, and rental paid by Ceramics to Tile. It was truly a running account and had all the appearances of a running loan account as its title said it was. 66 Mr Di Lorenzo gave evidence that there was never an intention that Ceramics make a loan to Tile. However, the gravamen of his evidence was that he intended only that his four daughters share equally and that he left all accounting and legal questions to the professionals. 67 Mrs Fresta, a qualified accountant, said that the choice of the language of \\\"loan\\\" had not accurately captured the relationship between Ceramics and Tile. She said of the running account: The various inflows and outflows went in favour of Tile Investments as intended. This net amount from Ceramics to Tile Investments was recorded by LCI as loan in the monthly management accounts. From an accounting perspective, I considered that this was a reasonable treatment to reflect that there was some arrangement between Ceramics and Tile Investments, and I myself had marked the ANZ bank statement entries involving these payments as loans to Tile Investments. I never thought any further about this accounting description of the transactions because I did not consider that the precisely correct characterisation of it was necessary for taxation purposes, until the ATO auditors made their assertions. There is in evidence a statement of account issued by ANZ in respect of Ceramics' bank account in which Mrs Fresta wrote \\\"Loan DL [or DC] Tile Invest\\\" against an entry for 14 June 2001 of a transfer of \\$259,467.96 out of the account.    The note recognised a loan by Ceramics to Tile. 68 Mrs Fresta also said that the intended arrangement was that she was to receive her one quarter share upfront, and that there was no discussion when the Unit Trust was established in 1999 about her having to subscribe for additional units. 69 Mr Incollingo was the person who had prepared the Annual General Ledger in relation to the \\\"Loan --- Di Lorenzo Property Group Unit Trust\\\". He emphasised that there was no separate bank account for the Unit Trust. According to Mr Incollingo, the error had come about because his staff had used a wrong coding --- 697 or 698 (\\\"loan\\\") instead of 780 (\\\"investment\\\"). (Mr Incollingo's affidavit refers to code 697, but in cross-examination he referred to code 698. ) He agreed that the Annual General Ledger of Ceramics recorded debit entries for payments of legal liabilities of Tile in connection with the construction work, that is to say, payments out to persons and companies who were creditors of Tile for goods and services provided in connection with the construction of the building on its land. Mr Incollingo insisted that the loan was in reality an \\\"investment\\\". 70 In cross-examination, senior counsel for the Commissioner took Mr Incollingo to the running balance of the account as between Ceramics and Tile, showing that the opening balance at 1 July 2001 of \\$841,704.87 was reduced to \\$780,648.62 as at 30 June 2002. (I note that the figure of \\$780,648.62 for the year ended 30 June 2002, taken from an exhibit to Mr Incollingo's affidavit, differs from the figure of \\$778,982.62 quoted in [44] above for the same period. The \\$780,648.62 figure appears in an untitled \\\"running balance\\\" sheet. The \\$778,982.62 figure appears in an exhibit to Mr Farrugia's affidavit being the \\\"Annual General Ledger\\\" of Ceramics from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002. The amount of \\$780,648.62 appears in only the one place and I assume that \\$778,982.62 is the correct figure. ) Senior counsel put it to Mr Incollingo that one does not ordinarily find an investment, but one does ordinarily find a running loan account, in the form of this account with, at times, a reducing balance. 71 Mr Incollingo agreed that the credit entries for rent from Ceramics, BAS refunds and the payments on account of the borrowing from ANZ, were all monies of Tile. He would not agree, however, to the proposition that the making of those credit entries was \\\"consistent with\\\" repayment of a loan to Tile from Ceramics. He did agree, however, that the Ceramics account and the Unit Trust account mirrored each other. 72 Mr Incollingo agreed that he had never protested to Mr Farrugia that the transaction was in fact not a loan but an investment. Mr Incollingo accepted that the response that he and Mr Laureti made to Mr Farrugia was that they could not understand how there could be a deemed dividend because \\\"that outcome was crazy\\\".    In fact, in Mr Incollingo's affidavit he stated: Once it became apparent to me that the correct characterisation of Ceramics' payments was important for taxation purposes, I considered the loan treatment was incorrect. 73 Mr Incollingo was taken to the Unit Trust income tax return for the year ended 30 June 2001 which recorded a current liability of \\$841,705 as at that date. He agreed that that entry reflected an indebtedness of the Unit Trust to Ceramics, and that if the payments made by Ceramics had been treated as an investment by it in the Unit Trust, that entry in the tax return would not have appeared. Mr Incollingo's explanation was, again, that the payments made by Ceramics out of its bank account had been wrongly shown as a loan to Tile in the various internal financial records. 74 It appears that neither Mr Di Lorenzo nor Mrs Fresta nor any other director or member of Ceramics or Tile gave close attention to the legal character that the payments made by Ceramics on account of Tile's liabilities was to bear. At least there is no evidence of an express agreement that those amounts were to represent either a loan or a subscription for additional units (no one has suggested that they were intended to be a gift). There was no agreement that the amounts were to be repaid by a particular date. There was no agreement that any particular number of additional units was to be issued. The proper characterisation of the payments was, however, left to Mr Incollingo. Mr Di Lorenzo and Mrs Fresta were content to leave it to him to characterise them as he saw fit and to prepare Ceramics' and the Unit Trust's financial statements and tax returns accordingly. One piece of evidence of express instruction is the reference to a loan to Tile written against entries in Ceramics' bank statements that were provided by Mrs Fresta to Mr Incollingo, although that evidence could be regarded as her acquiescence in the course that Mr Incollingo was already taking. 75 In my view there was a loan, because within the scope of his authority Mr Incollingo characterised the payments as loans, that is to say, as an indebtedness of Tile to Ceramics repayable upon demand. It was within the scope of Mr Incollingo's authority to establish a running loan account in the name of Tile, to treat the payments made by Ceramics as debits to it, and to treat the ANZ, rental and BAS receipts as repayments by Tile, as he in fact did. 76 I also do not overlook the convenience of treating as loans payments such as those made by Ceramics to another company under the same ownership and control where, as here, no decision is taken that they are to bear a different complexion. Treating them as loans allows the greatest flexibility for the treatment of them in the future as occasion arises. The company providing the funds might not only require repayment in whole or in part, and at one time or from time to time; it might forego repayment in whole or part, and at one time or from time to time, as consideration for one kind of benefit or another being conferred by the other company.    Acting within the scope of his authority, Mr Incollingo took the most convenient course. 77 There was no agreement that the amounts paid by Ceramics were subscriptions for units in the Unit Trust, and the making of such an agreement would have prompted consideration of several practical questions. When were the further units to be issued to Ceramics? How would the gross imbalance between the ever increasing number of units held by Ceramics as against the single unit held by Fresta be avoided? On what basis could one additional unit be issued to Fresta for every three additional units issued to Ceramics? Would there be successive further issues of units? No consideration was given to such questions at the time when the Unit Trust was established. 78 In this respect, Mr Incollingo's affidavit evidence is telling. He stated: Once it became apparent to me that the correct characterisation of Ceramics' payments was important for taxation purposes, I considered the loan treatment was incorrect. I considered an appropriate way to record properly Ceramics' payments was a further investment by Ceramics and Fresta in the Unit Trust, and that this should be formalised by way of the subscription for additional units in the Unit Trust. Because I knew it was always the intention of Jack and Maria that there be an investment into the Unit Trust and that the respective proportions should always remain 75/25, I considered it appropriate to record formally those decisions that had been informally made and in a way that reflected the formalities of the Unit Trust deed. I considered that the gift that Jack was in effect making to Maria (by reason that Fresta was attaining 25% of Ceramics' equity contribution) should be formally recorded as the subscription by Fresta of additional units equating to 25% of the issued units. Fresta's subscription was funded by Jack making a gift to Maria, who lent those funds to Fresta. Now shown to me and marked GI7 is a bundle of directors resolutions of Tile Investments made on 9 February, 2005. Now shown to me and marked GI8 is the unit register for the Unit Trust, which was altered on 9 February, 2005 to record the additional units. 79 It was as late as 9 February 2005 that Mr Incollingo prepared the minutes and made entries in the Register of Unitholders for the Unit Trust to which he refers in this passage. The minutes of the meeting of directors of Tile on 28 September 1999 provided for the issue of 1,600,000 units at an issue price of \\$1.00 each --- 1,200,000 to Ceramics and 400,000 to Fresta. But Mr Incollingo did not have instructions back on 28 September 1999 (the Unit Trust Deed was dated 27 September 1999) that such additional units were to be issued or that Ceramics was to give Fresta \\$400,000 with which to subscribe for one quarter of them.    80 Mr Incollingo has attempted to rewrite history in an effort to achieve what he considers to be a more fair and just result for his clients, and one that perhaps he thinks they would have agreed to if he had recommended it. 81 The applicants suggest that a treatment of the payments made by Ceramics on account of Tile's liabilities as an investment in units was somehow supportive of the 75 percent/25 percent arrangement, whereas a treatment of them as a loan was not. I disagree. The 75 percent/25 percent arrangement was fixed by the original issue of three units to Ceramics and one to Fresta. A fluctuating loan account as between Tile and Ceramics does not detract from that arrangement, but dictates the fluctuating value, from time to time, of the four units. 82 The authority given by Mr Di Lorenzo and Mrs Fresta to Mr Incollingo and the fluctuating account, its title, the numerous references to \\\"loan\\\" in the contemporaneous documents and also in things said by Mr Incollingo to Mr Farrugia show that there was a running loan account recording advances by way of loan from time to time by Ceramics to Tile. The loan was repayable on demand. Section 190D of the Act therefore has potential application. 83 In the alternative, the relationship between Tile and Ceramics that arose from the making of the payments by Ceramics at Tile's request in discharge of Tile's legal liabilities was that of creditor/debtor. The relevant common money count was that of \\\"money paid by the plaintiff to the use of the defendant\\\" or simply \\\"money paid\\\" as it came to be called. Section 109C(3)(a) of the Act refers to a payment on behalf of, or for the benefit of, an entity --- a concept that captures this alternative legal complexion of the payments that Ceramics made in discharge of Tile's liabilities. 84 I will consider the operation of ss 109C (payments) as well as of s 109D (loans). CONSIDERATION General 85 The parties were content to debate the applicability of s 109C or s 109D on the basis of a comparison between s 109C(3)(a) on the one hand, and s 109D(3)(c) on the other hand. The applicants seized on the presence of the words \\\"if there is an express or implied obligation to repay the amount\\\" in s 109D(3)(c), and submitted that this element was absent. For the reasons given above, I think there was an implied obligation to repay, but in any event, there would be a payment by Ceramics to Tile within s 109C, unless other submissions made by the applicants were to be accepted. 86 An important submission made by the applicants as to why neither section applied is that the payment or loan was not for the benefit of Tile, and that Div 7A does not apply to loans (or payments) made to a trustee. The submission is, in substance, that the dealings should be treated for present purposes as having been payments made by Ceramics to itself as to three quarters and to Fresta as to one quarter, because they were beneficially entitled under the terms of the Unit Trust Deed.    This submission is fundamental to other submissions made by the applicants, and I will address it below. 87 Tile in its capacity as trustee of the Unit Trust was an \\\"entity\\\". This results from the definition of \\\"entity\\\" in s 960-100 of the 1997 Act which defines \\\"entity\\\" to mean, inter alia, \\\"a trust\\\" and provides that the trustee of a trust is taken to be an entity consisting of the person who is the trustee at any given time (see [35] above). Importantly, the same section provides that a legal person can have a number of different capacities in which the person does things, and that in each of those capacities the person is taken to be a different entity. It follows that Tile, in its capacity as trustee of the Unit Trust, was an entity. 88 Section 109ZD provides that \\\"associate\\\" has the meaning given by s 318. As noted at [36] above, under s 318 Tile is an associate of Ceramics. 89 It is not disputed that if there was a loan (or payment) by Ceramics to Tile that was otherwise within s 109D (or s 109C), a reasonable person would have concluded that it was made because Tile was an associate of Ceramics. 90 A further matter that was not in dispute was that if there was such a loan (or payment) and a deemed dividend as a result, Ceramics and Fresta were presently entitled to the deemed dividend for the purposes of s 97(1) of the Act, Ceramics as to three quarters of the deemed dividend and Fresta as to one quarter of it. 91 Further, no argument was presented that the amount that Ceramics would be taken to have paid as a dividend to Tile at the end of Ceramics' years of income ended 30 June 2000 (\\$384,218.28) and 30 June 2001 (\\$841,704.87) was more than the amount of Ceramics' distributable surplus for those respective years, worked out under s 109Y of the Act. 92 It is important to appreciate that the Commissioner's case is not that dividends are deemed to have been paid to Ceramics and Fresta: it is that they are deemed to have been paid to Tile. The Commissioner's case is that subs 44(1) and Div 7A, especially s 109Z, have the effect that the amounts of the deemed dividends are included in the assessable income of Tile as trustee of the Unit Trust, and that it is Div 6, \\\"Trust Income\\\" (ss 95-102) of Pt III of the Act that operates to make those amounts part of the \\\"net income\\\" of the trust estate of the Unit Trust (s 95), and as to three quarters part of the assessable income of Ceramics and as to the remaining one quarter part of the assessable income of Fresta (s 97). Section 97 is applicable because Ceramics and Fresta were beneficiaries of the trust estate of the Unit Trust, were not under any legal disability, and were presently entitled under the Unit Trust Deed to shares of the income of the trust estate. 93 The applicants submit that Div 7A is directed only to \\\"beneficial interests\\\" and not to a loan (or payment) to a trustee. However, s 109ZD provides that in Div 7A \\\"entity\\\" has the meaning it is given by s 960-100 of the 1997 Act and s 109ZE provides that the rules in s 960-100 of the 1997 Act about entities applied to Div 7A.    The provisions to which I referred at [35] above make it clear that a legal person that has more than one capacity is taken to be a different entity in each such capacity. 94 The conclusion is inescapable that the loans (or payments) were made to Tile in its capacity as trustee of the Unit Trust. Even the minutes of the meeting of the directors of Tile on 28 September 1999 that Mr Incollingo wrote on 9 February 2005 treated at least \\$1,600,000 of the amounts that had been paid to Tile as having been paid to it in its capacity as trustee of the Unit Trust, albeit as the subscriptions for further units to be issued. The applicants' submission based on s 109K 95 The applicants rely on s 109K which, together with the note to it was set out at [29] above. The note does not form part of the Act. However, as already observed, s 109E to which the note refers makes the rules in s 960-100 of the 1997 Act about entities applicable to Div 7A. Section 960-100(4) has the effect that the expression \\\"another company\\\" in s 109K refers to another company as a company in its own right and not in any capacity as a trustee that it may bear, in the absence of a reference to the trustee capacity. The example given of the operation of s 960-100(4) set out at [35] above is just such a case.  96 To construe s 109K as not applying where a payment or loan is made to another company in its capacity as trustee is consistent with s 46(12) of the Act which denies the intercorporate dividend rebate to a trustee shareholder. That provision is as follows: A shareholder in a capacity of trustee is not, and is taken never to have been, entitled to a rebate under this section. 97 If s 109K operated to exclude from Div 7A loans (or payments) made by a private company to another company as trustee, the effect of the Division could easily be sidestepped by arrangements under which payments or loans were made to a company to be held on a \\\"bare\\\" trust for a shareholder in the private company or for an associate of such a shareholder. 98 I do not accept the applicants' submission based on s 109K of the Act. The applicants' submission that ss 109C and 109D are directed only to payments and loans to a person in that person's beneficial (non-trustee) capacity 99 The applicants submit that the expressions \\\"on behalf of\\\" and \\\"for the benefit of\\\" in s 109C(3)(a) and \\\"on behalf of\\\" in s 109D(3)(c) indicate that ss 109C and 109D are directed only to loans (and payments) to a person in that person's beneficial (non-trustee) capacity. The first difficulty I have with this construction is that, after all, the straightforward case of a payment of a dividend to an actual shareholder is not subject to any such limitation. Where shares are held by a trustee, a dividend paid to the trustee shareholder is income of the trust estate that includes the shares, and is governed by Div 6 of the Act. Nothing in Div 7A suggests that the position under that Division in respect of deemed dividends should be at all different. 100 The second difficulty is that other provisions within s 109C(3) and s 109D(3) point in the opposite direction.    Section 109C(3)(a) begins with \\\"a payment to the extent that it is to the entity, on behalf of the entity\\\" before adding the third possibility \\\"or for the benefit of the entity\\\". Similarly, s 109D(3) begins by referring to \\\"an advance of money\\\" and ends with a reference to \\\"a loan of money\\\" --- expressions which do not involve any notion of beneficial entitlement. 101 The terms of ss 109C(3) and 109D(3) do not suggest any limitation by reference to \\\"beneficial entitlement\\\". The language is simply neutral in this respect. I regard the various formulations with ss 109C(3) and 109D(3) as intended to give an ample and expansive coverage, and to be antithetical to any reading down of the kind suggested by the applicants. 102 Moreover, it is not a strained use of language to regard payments made in discharge of the legal liabilities of Tile at its request as having been made \\\"on behalf of [Tile] [and] for the benefit of [Tile]\\\" within s 109C(3)(a), and \\\"for, on account of, on behalf of [and] at the request of\\\" Tile, within s 109D(3)(c). Tile's liabilities in respect of the purchase and construction were not limited by reference to assets of the Trust. Its liability was unlimited. It is not inevitable, therefore, that every dollar paid by Ceramics in reduction of Tile's liabilities would benefit only the unitholders and confer no independent benefit on Tile. The interposition between Ceramics and the unitholders of the Unit Trust and of Tile as trustee of the Unit Trust 103 Fundamentally, the applicants' case is that the interposition of the Unit Trust and of Tile as trustee of it between Ceramics and the unitholders should be ignored. The applicants seek to have the case considered as one of payments made by Ceramics as to three quarters to itself and as to one quarter to Fresta. They submit that it is unrealistic and unjust that it should be considered otherwise. 104 In the course of submissions, reference was made to the discussion of \\\"unit trusts\\\" in Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226 and CPT Custodian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Victoria) [2005] HCA 53 ; (2005) 224 CLR 98. There was discussion in the judgments in those cases of such matters as the nature of the interest of a unitholder under the terms of the particular trust deed, a trustee's right of reimbursement out of the trust fund, and the question of a trustee's in personam right of exoneration against the beneficiaries. 105 I do not find it necessary to discuss in detail the present Unit Trust Deed or the matters just mentioned in the light of its terms. It suffices to say that under the Unit Trust Deed: • Ceramics and Fresta as the unitholders are beneficially entitled to the Trust Fund (as defined in the Deed) in proportion to the numbers of units registered in their respective names, but that neither of them has any interest in any particular part of the Trust Fund (cl 2.3); • Tile, as trustee, is required at the end of each financial year to determine the net income of the Trust Fund and the amount of any distribution to unit holders (cl 10.3); • if it fails to do    so, the income of the Trust Fund for that year is the \\\"net income\\\" of it determined in accordance with s 95(1) of the Act (cl 10.5); and • Tile as trustee is given expressly a right of indemnity out of the Trust Fund in respect of liabilities incurred by it (cl 31.3) but is not entitled to indemnity or reimbursement from the unitholders themselves (cl 31.4 --- an exclusion of the right of a trustee recognised in Hardoon v Belilios [1901] AC 118). 106 While the provisions mentioned indicate that it would be quite inconsistent with the terms of the Unit Trust to regard the case as one in which Ceramics and Fresta held the Trust Fund themselves, both the applicants and the Commissioner have proceeded on the basis that Ceramics and Fresta are presently entitled, as to three quarters and one quarter respectively, to the income of the Trust Fund. 107 For the year of income ended 30 June 2000, the Commissioner treated the income of the Unit Trust as increased by \\$384,218 representing the amount of the payments made by Ceramics to Tile in that year, and for the year of income ended 30 June 2001, the Commissioner treated the net income of the Unit Trust increased by \\$457,487 representing the net amount of the payments made by Ceramics to Tile during that year after allowing for credits. He treated Ceramics and Tile, as unitholders, as presently entitled, as to three quarters and one quarter respectively, to the income of the Trust Fund. 108 It is appropriate, therefore, to consider the position on assumptions most favourable to Ceramics and Fresta, namely, that Tile held the Trust Fund of the Unit Trust on a \\\"bare trust\\\" for them in the respective proportions mentioned, and that their respective present entitlements to the income arose from their present entitlement to capital under the bare trust. 109 In these circumstances, Ceramics and Fresta would still confront the difficulty that they now confront --- the interposition of the trust. Division 7A would still assimilate their position to that in which Tile held shares in Ceramics upon a bare trust for them. 110 If Tile held shares in Ceramics on a bare trust for Ceramics as to three quarters and Fresta as to one quarter, and Ceramics declared a dividend, the applicants would still face the difficulty that they now face. Tile would have received, as trustee, a dividend which would not attract the intercorporate dividend rebate under s 46 of the Act: see s 46(12) set out at [96] above. Tile would be required to disclose the income as income of the trust estate, although it would not be liable as trustee to pay income tax upon it (s 96 of the Act). However, Ceramics and Fresta would be liable to do so as beneficiaries of the trust estate who were not under any legal disability and were presently entitled to shares of the income of the trust estate (s 97 of the Act). 111 It would not be to the point for Ceramics and Fresta to complain that the substance of the matter was that they were shareholders receiving the dividend declared. By reason of the structure adopted, they would have made it impossible for themselves to be regarded as the shareholders. 112 In substance, the position in which Ceramics and Fresta find themselves under Div 7A is no different.    Instead of having actually paid a dividend to Tile as trustee, Ceramics is deemed to have done so, and instead of a bare trust for them, Tile holds on the terms of a unit trust under which they are, it is accepted, presently entitled to income. Once it is accepted that the deemed dividend provisions of Div 7A are enlivened, so are the provisions of Div 6. Intercorporate dividend rebate 113 The applicants submit that Ceramics is entitled to a rebate under s 46 of the Act by reason of the operation of s 45Z. They submit that, in the result, no additional tax is payable by Ceramics, and that its amended assessments are excessive. Their written submissions continue: Because the dividends are deemed to be unfranked, a further requirement for the s 46 rebate is that DLC [Ceramics] be a group company in relation to the company paying the dividend within s 46F. DLC [Ceramics] should be considered a group company. No rebate would be available to Fresta, because it is unlikely that s 46F could be read to cover it. In oral submissions, senior counsel for the applicants submitted that if the effect of Div 7A is that Ceramics is deemed to have received a dividend from itself, \\\"then at the very least it must be a group company and entitled to the dividend rebate\\\". 114 However, s 46F(2)(a)(i) has the effect that a shareholder is not entitled to a rebate under s 46 in respect of an unfranked dividend. The applicants are right to concede that the deemed dividends here are deemed to be unfranked because para (h) of the definition of \\\"frankable dividends\\\" in s 160APA excludes from the scope of this expression \\\"an amount taken to be a dividend under Division 7A of Part III\\\". 115 Subsection (3) of s 46F provides, however, that subs (2) of s 46F does not apply \\\"if the shareholder is a group company in relation to the company paying the dividend\\\". Apparently, the applicants' submission would require Ceramics to be treated as the \\\"shareholder\\\" as well as being \\\"the company paying the dividend\\\". 116 The expression \\\"group company\\\" in s 46F(3) has the same meaning that it has in s 160AFE: see s 46F(1) (\\\"group company\\\"). Section 160AFE(2) states that for the purposes of s 160AFE a group company is a group company in relation to another company if one of the two is a subsidiary of the other or both are subsidiaries of the same company. None of Ceramics, Fresta and Tile is a subsidiary of either of the other two and no two or more of them are subsidiaries of the same company. Accordingly, none of them is a \\\"group company\\\" in relation to either of the others. 117 For the above reasons, I do not accept the applicants' submission that Ceramics is entitled to a rebate under s 46. CONCLUSION 118 For the above reasons, the applications should be dismissed with costs.

He lodged an application for a protection visa under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 1 August 2005. The appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution due to his membership of the Shouters or Hui Fu Hui, an underground Christian Church in China. 2 In a written statement accompanying his visa application the appellant claimed that in 2003 nine policemen had broken up a meeting of his church group and had confiscated bibles, poetry and other publications. The appellant said that two members of the church group were arrested and accused of disseminating \\\"the religion\\\", and that the police threatened to arrest others if further meetings were held. After that, meetings of the church group continued to be held in different secret locations. The appellant said he became the \\\"main deacon of ecclesiae\\\" within the church group. The appellant went on to say that, notwithstanding their efforts to keep their meetings secret, on 12 May 2005 police had arrived at a meeting of the church group and tried to arrest those present. Further, the appellant said that five policemen broke into his home on 17 May 2005 intending to arrest him. He was not there at the time. The appellant said that he could not thereafter return to his house because he feared being arrested. He subsequently left China for Australia. The appellant stated that since his departure from China, his family has told him that he would be arrested and imprisoned should he return to China. 3 On 17 October 2005 a delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa. The delegate made adverse credibility findings in respect of the appellant. On 23 November 2005 the appellant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) for a review of the delegate's decision. The decision of the Tribunal 4 The appellant and his migration agent attended the hearing of the Tribunal on 27 February 2006. The appellant gave evidence at the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the appellant's migration agent requested that she have an opportunity to provide the Tribunal with a post-hearing submission. It was agreed that any such submission be received by 6 March 2006, failing which the Tribunal would proceed to make its decision on the materials then before it.    Under cover of a letter from his migration agent dated 6 March 2006, the appellant provided the Tribunal with a further statement and a copy of part of the decision made by the delegate. The covering letter stated \\\"for your continue to process his case and make a decision, [the appellant] would like to proved another statement to you as requested\\\" (sic). 5 In the enclosed statement, the appellant, after having referred specifically to the proceeding before the delegate and the adverse credibility findings made by him, said: I have to emphasize that all the information I provided in my previous statements is true and I told what I really experienced in my life. I know that in China if I persist in my religious belief I could never have my peaceful life and I would be arrested, beaten, tortured, and jailed like other brothers and sisters. There is evidence to prove what I said. 6 The Tribunal rejected the appellant's application for review and affirmed the delegate's decision. In the course of its reasons, the Tribunal referred on a number of occasions to the statements made in the written statement accompanying the appellant's visa application, as well as to the evidence that the appellant gave before the Tribunal. 7 The Tribunal found that the appellant had a sparse knowledge of Christianity and that this was at odds with his claim that he was a \\\"main deacon of ecclesiae\\\" within the church group. The Tribunal could not, therefore, be satisfied that the appellant was a member of a Christian Church in China. Further, the Tribunal stated that in his evidence at the hearing, the appellant had said that the police had broken up a church meeting at his home. The Tribunal observed that he had failed to make such a claim in his original visa application. 8 The Tribunal also referred to a discrepancy in the appellant's visa application and his evidence as to the events of 17 May 2005. In his visa application he said that on that day five policemen broke in to his home and tried to arrest him, but in evidence he said nine policemen had gone to another church person's place to arrest people. 9 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had been arrested, or threatened with arrest, or that he had ever come to the adverse attention of the police in China because of his religious beliefs or practices. The Federal Magistrate 10 In his amended application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant alleged that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by relying in its reasons on inconsistent statements he made in his written statement which formed part of his visa application - without providing the appellant with particulars in writing of that information. 11 The Federal Magistrate, in considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, found that the appellant \\\"republished by reference and reliance, and otherwise adopted the statement given in support of the visa application in its entirety by the letter and statement of 6 March 2006; and, in the absence of any other    statement, he 'gave' the information to the Tribunal during the hearing by relying upon it as 'correct' \\\". 12 The Federal Magistrate held that the inconsistent statement in the visa application, referred to by the Tribunal in its reasons, came within the exemption provided by s 424A(3)(b) of the Act. Accordingly, there was no breach of s 424A of the Act. The appeal 13 The notice of appeal comprises the following grounds: 1. DIMA made a wrong decision on my case of protection visa 2. RRT did not give me a fair review 3. RRT made jurisdictional errors. 14 At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant advanced no submissions in support of any of the grounds set out in the notice of appeal --- none of which identify an error by the Federal Magistrate in dealing with the only ground for review which was before the Federal Magistrate --- namely, that there had been a failure to comply by the Tribunal with s 424A of the Act. The appeal should, therefore, on the basis of the grounds referred to in the notice of appeal, be dismissed. However, counsel for the first respondent treated the appellant's notice of appeal as contending that the Federal Magistrate erred in determining that the Tribunal had not contravened s 424A of the Act and I am content to deal with the appeal on this basis. 15 Since the hearing of this appeal, the High Court has handed down the decision of SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26. That decision is fatal to the case advanced by the appellant. However, in my view, for the following reasons, the appeal also fails on another ground. 16 In my view, the Federal Magistrate did not err in deciding that by submitting his post- hearing statement under cover of the letter of 6 March 2006, the appellant adopted and verified the information contained in the statement accompanying his visa application and that, accordingly, s 424A(3)(b) applied to the information in the first statement. 17 Before the Federal Magistrate it was contended that the appellant's reference to \\\"my previous statements\\\" in his post-hearing statement (see [5] above), did not refer to the written statement which accompanied the visa application and referred only to his evidence given before the Tribunal. In my view, the appellant did by his 6 March 2006 statement adopt and verify the information in the statement accompanying the visa application. I draw this inference by reason of the juxtaposition of the paragraph in the post-hearing statement which verifies the \\\"previous statements\\\" and the immediately preceding paragraphs which refer to the adverse findings of the delegate. I note also that the document which accompanied the visa application was headed \\\"statement\\\" and that there was no other written document signed by the appellant before the Tribunal. 18 In my view, in his post-hearing statement, the appellant referred to, and verified, his statement accompanying the visa application for the purpose of rebutting the adverse    credibility findings made by the delegate and, also, to assuage the doubts expressed by the Tribunal as to the appellants credibility during the hearing. The submission was directed to excusing the appellant's poor performance whilst giving oral evidence at the Tribunal and resurrecting the veracity of the information contained in the statement accompanying the visa application. In my view, the following observations of Young J (with whom Gyles and Stone JJ agreed) in NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at 435-436, at [63] ( NBKT ) are applicable: Furthermore, by filing written submissions with the Tribunal that expressly referred to and incorporated the statement of grounds which was attached to her visa application, the appellant invited the Tribunal to refer to her protection visa application. As in M55 [2005] FCA 131 , there can be little doubt that the appellant intended that the Tribunal should look at her protection visa application and its attachments. This is a sufficient basis to find that the appellant gave the date of her protection visa application to the Tribunal for the purposes of the review application. 19 In NBKT the written submissions were delivered before the commencement of the hearing, whereas in this case they were delivered after the conclusion of the hearing. However, in my view, this is not a material difference because in both cases the information was given \\\"for the purpose of the application\\\" and so the requirements of s 424A(3)(b) of the Act were satisfied. 20 The appeal is dismissed with costs.

The proceedings were WAD 312 of 2006. The corporate respondents named were Kokos International Pty Ltd, and IAE Edu Net Perth Pty Ltd. Individuals sued were Chul Woo Kim, Young Gil Pae, Sang-Hong Jung trading as Nanuri Education Centre and Rebekah Cabalt. The application was for pecuniary penalties, injunctions and others orders pursuant to ss 76, 80 and 86C of the TP Act and of the Competition Policy Reform (Western Australia) Act 1996 together with declaratory relief pursuant to s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The ACCC says that Study Overseas Now was also a party to the conduct which is the subject of the proceedings. 3 On 7 December 2005 Patricia Yeo, in her capacity as a director of Study Overseas Now, lodged an application with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) under s 601AA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for voluntary deregistration of the company. The application embodied her declaration of the circumstances required by s 601AA(2) that: (a) All members of the company agree to the deregistration; and (b) the company is not carrying on business; and (c) the company's assets are worth less than \\$1,000; and (d) the company has paid all fees and penalties payable under this Act; and (e) the company has no outstanding liabilities; and (f) the company is not a party to any legal proceedings. 4 The records of ASIC show that the company was deregistered on 17 March 2006. The directors at the time of deregistration were Sachiko Suka, Yuriko Suka, Belinda Yeo, Pat Yeo and Noriko Suka. The ACCC wrote to Ms Belinda Yeo and Ms Pat Yeo on 10 April 2007 advising them that it intended to apply to the Court to have Study Overseas Now reinstated.    In its letter the ACCC informed the two former directors that based upon evidence and information which it had obtained it was of the view that the entry by the company into an arrangement with other education recruitment agents in Western Australia contravened s 45 of the TP Act and/or the Competition Code of Western Australia. It also stated its belief that it was appropriate to join Study Overseas Now and Mr Bernard Yeo to the proceedings and to seek declaratory and injunctive relief as well as pecuniary penalties against both parties. 5 The ACCC has attempted to locate the other directors. It appears that Sachiko Suka, Yuriko Suka and Noriko Suka left Australia for Japan in 2005 in the case of Noriko Suka and 2006 in the case of the other two directors. The Japanese Fair Trade Commission was unable to provide assistance about their addresses. The ACCC has been unable to contact them. 6 At a directions hearing on 15 May 2007 the two former directors Belinda and Patricia Yeo were given leave to appear in the proceedings and to file and serve any affidavits in opposition to the application for reinstatement by 5 June 2007. No such affidavits have been filed. However the solicitors for Belinda and Patricia Yeo have joined with the ACCC and ASIC in agreeing to orders reinstating the registration of the company. 7 A company, or a director or member of the company, or a liquidator of the company may apply, under s 601AA(1) for its voluntary deregistration. A person may apply only if the circumstances which were set out in Ms Yeo's application for deregistration and referred to earlier exist (s 601AA(2)). The applicant must give ASIC any information that it requests about current and former officers of the company (s 601AA(3)). Where ASIC is not aware of any failure to comply with the requirements of s 601AA it must give notice of the proposed deregistration on its data base and in the gazette. And when two months have passed since the gazette notice ASIC may deregister the company (s 601AA(4)). 8 Reinstatement of a deregistered company is provided for in s 601AH, the relevant parts of which are as follows: (1) ASIC may reinstate the registration of a company if ASIC is satisfied that the company should not have been deregistered. (2) The Court may make an order that ASIC reinstate the registration of a company if: (a) an application for reinstatement is made to the Court by: (i) a person aggrieved by the deregistration; or (ii) a former liquidator of the company; and (b) the Court is satisfied that it is just that the company's registration be reinstated. (3) If the Court makes an order under subsection (2), it may: (a) validate anything done between the deregistration of the company and its reinstatement; and (b) make any other order it considers appropriate. (4) ASIC must give notice of a reinstatement in the Gazette . If ASIC exercises its power under subsection (1) in response to an application by a person, ASIC must also give notice of the reinstatement to the applicant.    (5) If a company is reinstated, the company is taken to have continued in existence as if it had not been deregistered. A person who was a director of the company immediately before deregistration becomes a director again as from the time when ASIC or the Court reinstates the company. Any property of the company that is still vested in ASIC revests in the company. If the company held particular property subject to a security or other interest or claim, the company takes the property subject to that interest or claim. 9 The provisions of s 601AH(2) have the effect, relevant to this case, that the Court must be satisfied that the ACCC is a person aggrieved by the deregistration and that it is just that the registration be reinstated. The application of those statutory requirements was considered by Austin J in similar circumstances in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2000) 174 ALR 688. In that case the ACCC submitted that it had a public duty to improve competition and efficiency in markets and to foster a fair and competitive operating environment for businesses. One of the strategies used to achieve that objective is litigation in cases of serious breaches of the TP Act. The ACCC considered, in that case, that the conduct which it alleged was a serious example of price fixing and market sharing and that it had a duty in the public interest to reinstate and sue the perpetrator of some of that conduct. The former officers of the company then before the Court accepted that the ACCC had standing to apply as did his Honour. 10 In relation to standing, the present case is relevantly indistinguishable from that before Austin J. I find that the ACCC has the necessary interest in proceeding against the company in the discharge of its statutory functions such that it is \\\"a person aggrieved by the deregistration\\\" for the purposes of s 601AH(2). 11 In the case before Austin J the company whose reinstatement was sought had been placed in liquidation by a members' voluntary winding up. In the present case the company was voluntarily deregistered. A director of the company made a declaration of solvency on 7 December 2005 under s 601AA(2). 12 The ACCC accepts that where a reinstatement is sought in order to enable an applicant to pursue a claim against the company reinstated, it must appear that the claim has reasonable prospects of success or raises a serious question to be tried: Newham v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2000) 35 ACSR 147; Gausten v Outokumpu Australia Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of Western Australia, Master Sanderson 20/11/1998). 13 In her affidavit in support of the application for reinstatement, Bianca Sumner, a Project Officer employed by the ACCC, exhibited the written agreement which is at the heart of the proceedings instituted by the ACCC.    That agreement contained the following provisions: To all English Language Institutions in Perth The Perth International Student Agencies, which are KOKOS International Pty Ltd, IAE Edu Net WA, Study Overseas Now, Nanuri Education Centre and Jobbok International, have organized an agreement along with the Council of Korean Agency. The agreement is proposed to prevent excessively discounted fees offered by the agencies mentioned above. The agencies pledges (sic) to offer fair dealings accordingly to the agreed conditions which are listed below that all International students (including Working Holiday Makers & Tourists) will not be offered discounts beyond the noted amount on the school's invoice. Unfortunately the problem has arisen to enormous proportions in Sydney and it sets a fine example. The agents there are competing with each other by offering 15-20% off their own commission to students. In result of this, students are taking this matter to their advantage and requesting for more concessions. It is believed that all persons it concern (sic) do not want this predicament to occur in this market in Perth. Therefore, The Council of Korean Agency wishes to monitor and control unfair commissions apart from official privileges offered by Education Institutes. It is also aimed to all Institutions to cooperate within the agreement for fair dealings in the Korean Market. Listed below are the agreed conditions: 1. The five agencies in Perth will organize a Net Work System and cooperate by working together and monitoring any illegal activities. 2. All other agencies should follow the system, which has been organized by the five agencies mentioned above, and carry it into an effect. 3. If any of the five agencies as well as others has performed unfair illegal activities will face a penalty fee ordered by the Council of Korean Agency. 4. All Education Institutions in Perth to cooperate by reporting to the Council of Korean Agency if any illegal activities are performed by any agencies. .  No enrolment for school for 3 months. On the face of it the evidence of the agreement indicates that the ACCC's claim has reasonable prospects of success. 14 There are obvious public interest considerations in favour of the litigation proceeding against all companies said to have been party to the arrangements of which the ACCC complains.    Given that those proceedings are still pending it is neither necessary nor desirable to enter upon any further analysis of their merits. It is sufficient to say that on the materials before the Court it is just that the company be reinstated. 15 In this case the Court is making an order by consent of the parties. In so doing it must be satisfied that the order is within power and appropriate. Where a proposed consent order satisfies those conditions, the Court will ordinarily make an order to give effect to the agreement which the parties have reached. 16 I will make the order as proposed.

Two Australian companies and their director seek leave to serve an application out of the jurisdiction on two English companies. That is not unusual. What is unusual is that the application they wish to serve in England is an application for preliminary discovery pursuant to O 15A of the Federal Court Rules . It is not in terms limited to documents within Australia. Indeed, it is apparent from the evidence before the Court that the bulk of the documents sought are likely to be found in England and not in Australia. 2 The events which have led to this application began with the development, by a West Australian Mr Alan Burns, of a new form of marine propulsion system. The principal elements of the system were described in a Provisional Patent Application PQ8024 filed in the Australian Patent Office on 7 June 2000. The invention was said to have been devised particularly, although not solely, as a propulsion system for propelling watercraft. It relied upon the expulsion of a jet of water from an outlet to propel watercraft in the opposite direction. It could also have other applications including the pump-like propulsion of a stream of water such as in fire fighting hoses. A claimed advantage of the invention over existing water jet propulsion systems was that it did not require the use of an impeller driven by an internal combustion engine. That system was said to involve cavitation and other efficiency limitations and to involve loss of heat energy. 3 As described, in one of its aspects, the system has an intake connecting with a source of \\\"working fluid\\\" (the water in which the boat floats) and an outlet through which that water is propelled. It provides a means for introducing a jet of \\\"driving fluid\\\" into a mixing zone in a flow direction towards the outlet. The interaction between the driving and working fluids generates a pressure reduction which causes the working fluid to be drawn from its source (the water in which the boat floats) and propelled to the outlet. The driving fluid is typically a gas at high temperature such as steam or the exhaust gases from an engine or a combination of those things. Compressed gas, high pressure water or hot water or any combination of them could also be used. Where the working fluid is aerated by the driving fluid then the density of the two phase mixture is reduced. This was said to assist the transfer of the working fluid towards the mixing chamber.    4 Provisional patent applications for related inventions were filed by Mr Burns in February 2001. They were the following: PR2868 5 February 2001 Heat Exchanger PR3310 23 February 2001 Heat Recovery System PR3311 23 February 2001 Propulsion System PR3312 23 February 2001 Nozzle Means Each of these patent applications concerns aspects of what is described in papers before the Court as the \\\"Burns Propulsion Technology\\\". They represent various elements of a marine drive unit. 5 Companies set up by Mr Burns, Carnegie Corporation Limited (Carnegie) and its subsidiary, New Millenium Engineering Pty Limited (NME) made an agreement in September 2000, providing for the assignment of intellectual property rights associated with his technology to an English company, Pursuit Dynamics Plc (Pursuit Dynamics). The agreement provided, inter alia, for the ongoing payment to NME by Pursuit Dynamics of a royalty of 1% of revenue derived from exploitation of the technology. On its face the agreement conferred royalty rights in respect of the exploitation of widely defined \\\"improvements\\\" to the technology. Variation agreements made in March and June 2001 related to the restructuring of Pursuit Dynamics and the setting up of Pursuit Marine Drive Limited (Pursuit Marine) as its holding company. 6 Carnegie and NME complained to Pursuit Dynamics that it and Pursuit Marine had lodged patent applications and licensed associated rights to third parties without accounting for the revenue generated from those activities on which royalties may have been payable under the agreement. Pursuit Dynamics and Pursuit Marine responded that the subsequent technology which they have developed and licensed falls outside the scope of the agreement with Carnegie and NME. They say they are not liable to pay royalties in respect of that exploitation. 7 Carnegie and NME evidently do not feel they have sufficient material upon which to determine whether they have a reasonable cause of action against Pursuit Dynamics or Pursuit Marine. They seek preliminary discovery against them in order to decide whether or not to commence proceedings and against whom. But Pursuit Dynamics and Pursuit Marine are English companies and have not submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court in respect of the application for preliminary discovery. They maintain, for a variety of reasons that such an application could not succeed. They say that the agreement is explicitly governed by English law and that an arbitration process precludes resort to litigation. They also contend, as a matter going to discretion, that the law of the United Kingdom precludes the use of Letters of Request in aid of the enforcement of discovery orders in that country. 8 Although Pursuit Dynamics and Pursuit Marine have not submitted to this jurisdiction they have sent a letter to the Court through their solicitors outlining their contentions.    In the meantime, notwithstanding their invocation of the arbitration clause against Carnegie and NME, they have commenced proceedings in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in England (Patents Court) seeking declarations as to the proper construction of the agreement made in September 2000 and subsequent variations in March and June 2001. 9 The issues for determination in the motion for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction are: 1. Whether the Court's power to give leave to serve originating process out of the jurisdiction extends to this application. 2. Whether there are discretionary considerations relevant to the grant of such leave independent of the merits of the application for preliminary discovery. The Option Agreement --- 20 September 2000 10 On 30 September 2000 Carnegie and NME made an agreement with Pursuit Dynamics. The nature of the agreement was outlined in its recitals which were in the following terms: A. Alan Robert Burns (\\\" ARB \\\") has invented and designed a \\\"marine drive system\\\" as identified in Schedule 1 (the \\\" Invention \\\"), and is interested in the protection, development and exploitation of the Invention (the \\\" Project \\\" as hereinafter defined). B. ARB and NME have entered into an agreement under which NME is developing the Invention and is earning an interest in the Project in accordance with the terms of a Heads of Agreement entered into with ARB dated 23 November 1999, a copy of which is appended hereto as Appendix 1 and has acquired a 50% interest in the Project including in the Intellectual Property (as hereinafter defined); C. ARB continues to own all other rights in the Intellectual Property and in the Project; D. Pursuit Dynamics wishes, to acquire an option on all NME's entitlements under and interest in the Intellectual Property obtained under the above Heads of Agreement; E. NME is a wholly owned subsidiary of Carnegie. 11 Under cl 3.1 NME granted Pursuit Dynamics the exclusive right to acquire its legal and beneficial interest in the \\\"Intellectual Property\\\" (as defined in cl 1.1 of the agreement) and otherwise in the \\\"Project\\\" which was also a defined term. The Option thus granted involved four steps designated Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 and Stage 4. The Stage 1 Option appeared to involve the provision by NME of all information reasonably required by Pursuit Dynamics and all reasonable assistance in order to enable it to continue with its due diligence into the Project. Pursuit Dynamics undertook to expend a minimum of UK[sterling]100,000 on research and development work on the Project within six months of the exercise of the Stage 1 Option. 12 The Stage 2 Option was available at any time up to the expiry of six months following exercise of the Stage 1 option and the expenditure of not less than UK[sterling]100,000. Under the Stage 2 Option NME undertook to assign to Pursuit Dynamics a half share (as tenant in common) of all NME's legal and beneficial interest in the Intellectual Property.    Pursuit Dynamics undertook to expend a further minimum UK[sterling]500,000 on research and development within 12 months from the exercise of the Stage 2 Option. Carnegie shareholders were to receive, as at the date of exercise of the option on a pro rata basis, shares in Pursuit Dynamics equivalent to a 10% interest in it. 13 The Stage 3 Option arose after the expenditure of UK[sterling]500,000 pursuant to the Stage 2 Option. Under the Stage 3 Option Pursuit Dynamics would issue Carnegie shareholders shares in Pursuit Dynamics equivalent to a further 10% interest in that company and would pay to Carnegie UK[sterling]150,000. NME would assign to Pursuit Dynamics the balance of all of its legal and beneficial interest in the Intellectual Property. Stage 4 provided that upon the acquisition of all of Carnegie's interest in the Project, Pursuit Dynamics would then solely fund it to commercialisation. There was a royalty provision in cl 10 which provided that Pursuit Dynamics would pay to NME a royalty of 1% of revenues. 14 There was provision for the calculation of royalties. Pursuit Dynamics was required to determine the amount of royalties on an interim basis from the revenue figures in their management accounts for the relevant period (cl 11.1). A final amount was to be calculated from the final audited annual accounts for the relevant auditing period. Pursuit Dynamics was also required under cl 11.8 to keep, during the term of the agreement and for seven years after the end of the relevant accounting period \\\"proper, complete, full and accurate records of matters relevant to the calculation of royalties at least as are reasonably necessary to verify the calculation of royalties hereunder\\\". There was provision in cl 11.9 for NME to inspect such records by an independent auditor for the purpose of verifying the royalty calculation. 15 There was a dispute resolution provision in cl 17 which required the parties to first use all reasonable endeavours to resolve disputes or differences \\\"arising out of or in connection with this Agreement\\\". If they could not settle the dispute then any party had a right to give one month's written notice that the matter should be referred to arbitration. This provision did not mandate arbitration but simply gave a right to refer a matter to arbitration. It does not appear that any written notice was given in this case. Indeed, Pursuit Dynamics has resorted to court action. 16 Clause 28 provided: This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of England and each party irrevocably submits unconditionally to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England. 17 Relevant definitions in the agreement were the definitions of \\\"Intellectual Property\\\", \\\"Improvement\\\", \\\"Patents\\\" and \\\"Project\\\": \\\" Intellectual Property \\\" means: (a) all rights in the Invention, and the Patent; (b) all Know-How; (c) all other inventions, patents, patent applications, designs, computer programs, techniques, ideas, processes, data, know- how, show-how, discoveries and works (including literary and artistic works and other    copyright works); (d) all modifications and improvements; (e) all new technology arising from or derived from; made, created, discovered, written or conceived in relation to the Invention or in the course of carrying out the Project. The term \\\"Invention\\\" was uninformatively designated as \\\"having the meaning ascribed to it above\\\". There was no definition \\\"above\\\" or anywhere else in the agreement. 18 The term \\\"Improvement\\\" was defined: \\\" Improvement \\\" means any change in, development of or improvement and/or modification to the Invention (whether patentable or not) including (without limitation) any change, improvement or modification which makes the Invention more efficient or adaptable made or acquired by NME, Carnegie or their Associates, or Pursuit Dynamics as the case may be, including in the case of NME and Carnegie or their Associates in any work carried out prior to the date of this Agreement. 19 The term \\\"Patents\\\" was also defined thus: \\\" Patents \\\" means the patent application identified in Schedule 1, together with any other application corresponding to or based on or claiming priority from or otherwise claiming the Invention or any other invention disclosed in or contemplated by that application, and any patents granted thereon, in any country of the world; And also \\\"Project\\\": \\\" Project\\\" means the protection, development and exploitation of the Invention, the Intellectual Property, and all commercial and other applications thereof; 20 In Schedule 1 the following appeared: Identification of Invention and scope of invention: Provisional Patent Application Number (identified PQ8024), filed in the Australian Patent Office, on 7 th June 2000 under the title \\\"Propulsion Systems\\\", applied for in the name of and invented by Alan Robert Burns a copy of which has been initialed (sic) and dated by the parties on the date of execution of this Agreement. The Variation Agreements --- March and June 2001 21 A Deed of Variation dated 14 March 2001 recited that Pursuit Dynamics had established a proposed new holding company, Pursuit Marine. Pursuit Marine was then intending to make an application for its ordinary share capital to be admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. Immediately prior to that application its brokers Numis Securities Ltd were to have used their reasonable endeavours to procure that investors subscribe for shares in Pursuit Marine under a Placing Agreement. It was then intended that all of the issued shares in Pursuit Dynamics would be exchanged for the same number of shares in Pursuit Marine. The variation was designed to take account of that restructuring arrangement. Carnegie was to receive the same percentage holding in Pursuit Marine as it had in Pursuit Dynamics. There were other variations which are not material for present purposes. Although it appears to be assumed by all parties that Pursuit Marine was under contractual obligations to Carnegie, NME and Mr Burns like those of Pursuit Dynamics it is not clear when and how that occurred. I will assume in favour of the applicants that that is the case.    22 A second Deed of Variation was recorded in a letter of 27 June 2001 signed by both Pursuit Marine and Carnegie. The changes effected by that deed are also immaterial for present purposes. 23 It appears that the post-September 2000 developments the subject of Provisional Patent Applications by Mr Burns in 2001 will have fallen within the scope of the Intellectual Property of which Pursuit Dynamics had a right to take an assignment pursuant to cl 12 of the Option Agreement. Correspondence and communications between the parties 24 As appears from later correspondence Carnegie noted in May 2005 that Pursuit Dynamics had reported revenue generating licensing arrangements for the Invention and requested that its royalty entitlements be attended to. Pursuit Dynamics had responded that it did not believe that its licensing arrangements related to the Invention. Mr Heathcote of Pursuit Dynamics advised Mr Hopkins, the managing director of Carnegie, in May 2005 that preliminary advice received from Pursuit Dynamics' UK patent attorneys was that the new patents did not rely on any of the claims of those acquired from Carnegie and others. It was as if an independent inventor had come up with the developments. As a result Pursuit Dynamics did not believe that the royalty obligation applied. In the event Pursuit Dynamics said it would have its commercial lawyers review the agreements between the parties. This process dragged on for an extraordinarily long time. 25 On 23 May 2005 Mr Heathcote sent an email to Mr Hopkins stating that the royalties due to Carnegie were limited to the invention disclosed in Australian Provisional Patent Application PQ8024, a family member of PCT/AU01/00677 and any improvements and developments of that invention. The email continued: We are advised that the majority of the work we have been undertaking here over the past few years falls outside the scope of this patent and therefore outside the scope of our agreement on royalties. 26 In a letter of 9 September 2005 to Mr Heathcote, Mr Hopkins referred to the commercial agreements between the companies and the definitions of Intellectual Property and Improvements. He referred to a website used by Pursuit Dynamics and a brochure showing how what it called PDX technology worked. Mr Hopkins said in his letter that \\\"this still looks a lot like the technology we sold to Pursuit\\\". He noted that he had had no response from Pursuit Dynamics since that company had agreed to request its commercial lawyers to check the agreements. A number of additional licences had since been issued. He asked that the matter be addressed with some urgency. 27 The materials before the Court include an extract from a share market newsletter of 9 July 2002, published by Numis Securities Ltd which was involved with the Pursuit Dynamics restructuring.    It contained an article about Pursuit Dynamics. In that newsletter it was stated that the company was formed in 2000 to exploit innovative pumping technology invented in Australia which has no moving parts in the fluid being pumped. Its flotation in May 2001 raised funds to complete the acquisition of the Intellectual Property from the founder and his backers. Pursuit Dynamics had identified the marine outboard motor as its initial target market. The article went on: Since flotation Pursuit Dynamics has transferred the technology from Australia and undertaken a full scientific investigation of the phenomenon of pumping water utilising steam and air. Initial scientific verification was undertaken at independent facilities but since December Pursuit has established its own development facility at Royston, Hertfordshire, in which it has the capability of simulating the movement of the motor through the water in its own customised flume (tank with pumped water flow). The article went on to state that initial scientific verification of the technology had given way to the performance enhancement of the pump's prime sections and the optimisation of the design. Reference was made to the development of a demonstration prototype to be installed in a boat and the development of the pumping technology for additional markets such as the nuclear and chemical industries. It then stated: Pursuit is seeking to licence its technology to companies in the targeted markets, thus avoiding the manufacturing infrastructure costs as well as the need for worldwide post sales/support. 28 Carnegie pursued its royalty inquiry with Pursuit Dynamics through a series of email exchanges in the latter part of 2005 and in early 2006. There were repeated delays for which Pursuit Dynamics apologised on the basis that it was still awaiting legal advice. Ultimately in April 2006 Mr Gary Pyle, the Chief Financial Officer of Pursuit Dynamics told Mr Hopkins that he and Mr Heathcote had met their lawyers the previous Tuesday afternoon and had been advised to refer the matter to counsel. Further exchanges and a meeting occurred in August 2006 without any resolution. 29 On 23 November 2006 Wright Legal, the solicitors for Carnegie, NME and Mr Burns, wrote to Mr Heathcote. They pointed out that despite numerous requests by Carnegie Pursuit Dynamics had failed to explain or justify its denial of royalty entitlements with respect to applications currently developed by Pursuit Dynamics and its third party licensees. They attached a schedule of patent applications comprising the Pursuit Dynamics portfolio. They said: The research and development pathway followed by Pursuit Dynamics has resulted in each of the various inventions as claimed by Pursuit Dynamics, as referred to below, each of which are based on or derived from the Invention and Intellectual Property, as referred to in the Option Agreement.    The subject inventions controlled by Pursuit Dynamics are reflected in the various applications detailed in the schedule as annexed to this letter. They asserted that the technological developments reflected in the Pursuit Dynamics patent portfolio fell within the scope of the Intellectual Property covered by the Option Agreement and attracted the royalty obligations under cl 10 of that agreement. They requested that Pursuit Dynamics make available for inspection: . all documents recording or evidencing the design, research and development of the inventions claimed in the specifications of each and every of the applications comprised in the Pursuit Dynamics Patent Portfolio; . all documents recording or evidencing commercial exploitation of the said inventions, and each of them, including (but not limited to) advertising and promotional material, and any contract or other commercial documentation relating to the said exploitation; and . documents recording or evidencing revenue derived from the sale or other supply of products or services covered by the Inventions the subject of the Patents, as referred to in clause 10.2 of the Option Agreement and/or the Patent Rights, as referred to in clause 7.2 of the said Agreement. 30 The request for discovery was said to be made on the basis that Carnegie had reasonable grounds for believing it had or might have a right to bring legal proceedings against Pursuit Dynamics for breach of the contract obligations in relation to payment of the royalty, as required under cl 10.1 of the Option Agreement. Reference was then made to O 15A rr 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules . The solicitors requested a response in writing by 28 November 2006 as to whether Pursuit Dynamics would comply with the request. It does not appear that any reliance was placed upon cls 11.8 and 11.9 of the Option Agreement. 31 Further correspondence was exchanged between the parties which led to Carnegie extending the time allowed for Pursuit Dynamics to reply until 2 February 2007. 32 Pursuit Dynamics' solicitors, Eversheds LLP wrote to Wright Legal on 24 January 2007 seeking confirmation that it was their contention that any order for discovery made by the Federal Court could operate extra-territorially notwithstanding: 1. The fact that Pursuit Dynamics was an English company whose main place of business was in the United Kingdom. 2. The documents of which disclosure were sought were likely to be situated entirely in the United Kingdom; and 3. The operative agreements governing the contractual relationship between Carnegie and Pursuit Dynamic were subject to English law with an English forum arbitration provision. 33 In a reply dated 25 January 2007 Wright Legal said that Carnegie was not willing to permit the process to be delayed further. They also foreshadowed that any application for pre-action discovery under O 15A r 3 and O 15A r 6 would be made on notice and not ex parte.    They contended that the existence of the governing law clause and the dispute resolution clause did not constitute an ouster of Federal Court jurisdiction. They repeated the request that Pursuit Dynamics provide details of its nominated legal representative in Western Australia for service of process in the event that it declined to provide the requested documents. 34 On 1 February 2007 without prior notice and notwithstanding their solicitors' contentions about the arbitration provision, Pursuit Marine and Pursuit Dynamics commenced proceedings in the Patents Court in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in England. They sought a declaration that upon a proper construction of the contractual arrangements between the parties: (i) the first claimant (Pursuit Marine) was not in breach of its contractual obligations to Carnegie or NME or Mr Burns or any of them in relation to the payment of royalties under the Agreement; (ii) Carnegie, NME and Mr Burns were not entitled to disclosure of documents demanded by the letter dated 23 November 2006 and subsequent letters of Wright Legal. They sought a declaration that the defendants were not entitled to injunctive relief against them for breach of confidence or by way of enforcement of intellectual property rights generally and that they, the claimants, had not acted in breach of confidence or infringed any intellectual property rights of the defendants or any of them. A copy of the claim form was sent to Wright Legal \\\"for your information\\\" with a letter of 1 February 2007 by post and email. In the letter Eversheds LLP said: Pursuit is faced with unwarranted demands for royalties and the disclosure of documentation. Our first letter today sets out Pursuit's position and its rejection of those demands. It seems likely to us however, that your clients will persist in their claims and demands. To give Pursuit the certainty it requires for its business activities, the legal proceedings represented by the Claim Form have been issued. The English court is plainly the appropriate forum to deal with these proceedings. The agreements concerned both contain English governing law clauses. They deal with activities which take place in England. Most of the material witnesses, documents and other subject matter are situated in England. They foreshadowed an application to the High Court in the normal way for service out of the jurisdiction on Carnegie, NME and Mr Burns. 35 In a contemporaneous letter Eversheds LLP set out their clients' case more fully. They asserted, inter alia: 1. Pursuit Dynamics was formed with the sole intention of exploiting the Burns Marine Drive. Documents disclose \\\"very clearly\\\" that the technology which it purchased was the Marine Drive and the money raised was to commercialise that technology. That proved fruitless because it was impossible to achieve commercial reduction to practice.    Pursuit Dynamics invested in Marine Drive technology but that was not what it was currently pursuing or exploiting. 2. The \\\"intention\\\" of the agreements was to document a transaction by which Burns/ Carnegie sold Marine Drive to Pursuit Dynamics. Burns and Carnegie were paid for the technology. Carnegie was now contending that the agreements supported a royalty of 1% on \\\"virtually anything which Pursuit does\\\". This was based on the definition of \\\"Intellectual Property\\\" in the Option Agreements. That definition does not make sense as a matter of English. Pursuit's case was that in 2000 it purchased Marine Drive and that its agreements are confined to that. If necessary, Pursuit would seek rectification of the agreements. 3. At a technical level, Pursuit's technology was substantially different from the Burns/ Carnegie technology such that it could not be said to be either a modification of or improvement of the Burns Marine Drive technology. 36 Contentions were then advanced about the essence of the Burns Marine Drive technology. Pursuits' solicitors claimed that in 2002 Pursuit Dynamics, having been unable to reduce the Burns' technology to practice in a commercial manner, set about developing different products which offered a better commercial return. It developed different principles and geometrics and produced technology aimed at completely different markets. It maintained that none of Pursuit Dynamics current patents or patent applications (other than the original Burns patent family) had any application in the field of marine propulsion but were used in the field of fluid mixing, mixing fluids with solids and powders, heating, cleaning, sterilising, fluidization, degassing, fire suppression, decontamination, volatile stripping and smoke suppression. The solicitors invited Carnegie's patent attorney, at a time to be agreed, to have an open discussion with Pursuit Dynamics' patent attorney, Mr Murnane of Murgitroyd & Company so that he could explain the difference between the Marine Drive and Pursuit Dynamics' current technology. 37 Pursuit Dynamics was not prepared to concede any entitlement on the part of Burns/Carnegie to royalties under the Option Agreement nor to disclose commercially confidential documentation to them. They expressed the view that Carnegie was showing an intention to engage in a fishing expedition for documents to which it was not entitled on the basis of a cause of action under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA) which lacked any real substance. The application for preliminary discovery 38 These proceedings were commenced by an application for preliminary discovery brought pursuant to O 15A r 3(2)(a), (b) and 3(3)(a) and (b), 6 and 12 of the Federal Court Rules .    The discovery sought covers all documents which are or have been in the possession, custody or power of Pursuit Dynamics and/or Pursuit Marine: ... in respect of the design, research, experimentation and development ( R&D ) of each of the inventions claimed in the specifications and claims of each and every of the patents and/or patent applications comprising the Pursuit Dynamics Patent Portfolio... The latter term is defined by reference to the affidavit of Mark Anthony Pullen, a patent attorney who has sworn an affidavit in these proceedings based upon an examination of patents applied for by Pursuit Dynamics and Pursuit Marine. The discovery sought also extends to: ... documents recording or evidencing all and any instructions and/or directions from Pursuit Dynamics and/or Pursuit Marine Drive to each of the claimed inventors in relation to the R&D of each of the inventions claimed in the specification and claims of each and every of the patents and/or patent applications comprising the Pursuit Dynamics Patent Portfolio ... 39 A list of named inventors is then set out. In addition discovery is sought of all documents filed with the Patents Office in Australia and any Patent Office elsewhere in the world by any patent attorney for Pursuit Dynamics and/or Pursuit Marine in relation to each of the patents and/or patent applications comprised in the Pursuit Dynamics portfolio. The categories of documents thus sought are elaborated by definitions of the term \\\"documents\\\". The exercise upon which Pursuit Dynamics and Pursuit Marine would be required to embark were the application to be granted is likely to be massive. 40 Filed with the application was a motion which had two limbs. Under the first Carnegie and NME sought leave to serve the application out of the jurisdiction on the two respondents. The second limb sought the preliminary discovery claimed by the application itself. Why the relief claimed in the application was repeated as relief claimed in the interlocutory motion is not apparent. Whether leave to serve the application in England can and should be given 41 The power of the Court to grant leave to serve a process on a person in a foreign country is defined by O 8 of the Federal Court Rules . It is a power in aid of the exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction. It is therefore an exercise of judicial power within the meaning of Ch 3 of the Constitution . So too is an order under O 15A for preliminary discovery. Although an application for preliminary discovery is an application in a proceeding it does not yield substantive final relief. It is interlocutory in character. It involves the exercise of a power in aid of the jurisdiction of the Court which must be identified by reference to a matter in respect of which preliminary discovery is sought. 42 Order 15A is premised upon the proposition that the discovery sought, whether it be identity discovery under r 3 or discovery to enable the applicant to decide whether    it has the right to obtain relief, relates to the prospective invocation of the jurisdiction of the Court in a claim for relief against an identified or yet to be identified respondent. Finn J put it thus in Air Services Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 886 ; (1999) 92 FCR 200 (at 208): 27. Ordinarily a court's jurisdiction is enlivened by an initiating process seeking a determination of the substantive claim one party alleges it has against another. But ... such need not necessarily be the case. Necessity may require otherwise if a person's right is to be vindicated in a substantive claim. Preliminary discovery of the types provided in O 15A rr 3 and 6 have long been accepted as a proper and appropriate precursor to the making of a substantive claim --- and appropriate because it assists in the administration of justice in relation to the making of the claim itself. There is no reason for present purposes to distinguish between the two types of discovery. Each reflects a different necessity. 28. Though in form a discrete proceeding (as was the old bill of discovery: see the quotation from Story ) preliminary discovery is, as a matter of substance, properly to be regarded as interlocutory in character in that it does not, nor is it intended to, determine finally the rights inter se of the parties to the substantive application: cf Malouf v Malouf [(1999) [1999] FCA 284 ; 86 FCR 134]. Its function rather is to assist in that determination when or if the substantive application is brought consequent upon what is revealed in the preliminary discovery itself. 29. In consequence I consider an O 15A order for preliminary discovery to be an unexceptionable exercise of judicial power when made in relation to the matter necessitating the making of the order. 43 Tamberlin J, like Finn J, had been confronted with a challenge to the validity of O 15A in Kirella Pty Ltd v Hooper [1999] FCA 169 ; (1999) 92 FCR 90. He held that the rule did not purport to confer jurisdiction on the Court. Rather it was \\\"... an exercise of the rule making power by the judges in accordance with s 59 of the Federal Court Act \\\". And further (at 99 [46]): The Court has the necessary jurisdiction because, at the time when preliminary discovery is sought in the present case, there is a matter in existence and the grant of preliminary discovery is an exercise of power with respect to that matter. The Full Court dismissed an appeal against the decision of Tamberlin J in Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 167 ALR 358. 44 In this case the jurisdiction in aid of which the order for preliminary discovery is sought is said to relate to matters arising under the TPA and breaches by Pursuit Dynamics of the Option Agreement.    The causes of action said to arise under the TPA, in respect of which this Court has jurisdiction, were not expressed with precision. They were said to arise in Australia against Pursuit Dynamics and Pursuit Marine to the extent that they have been involved directly or indirectly in exploiting any of the inventions the subject of the Pursuit Dynamics Patent Portfolio by asserting a right in trade or commerce that they, and each of them, are lawfully entitled to do so without regard to the obligations arising under the Option Agreement. They were said thereby prima facie to have: (a) engaged in trade or commerce in misleading or deceptive conduct or conduct likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of s 52 of the TPA ; and (b) made false or misleading representations in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services or in connection with the promotion by any means of same, contrary to the proscription of s 53. 45 Attempts, in oral argument, to elicit a more precise explanation of how misleading or deceptive conduct or representations arose out of the exploitation by Pursuit Dynamics and/or Pursuit Marine of the Pursuit Dynamics Patent Portfolio did not meet with great success.  Assuming for the moment, the correctness of Carnegie and NME's contention that the respondents have been engaged in exploiting intellectual property which falls within the extended definition of that term in the Option Agreement, the entitlement which arises under the agreement is an entitlement to royalties. Carnegie, NME and Mr Burns have not terminated the agreement. They are not asserting any ownership entitlement in respect of the intellectual property rights being exploited by the respondents. Absent any contention of any legal or beneficial interest on the part of Carnegie or NME in the intellectual property rights currently being exploited by the respondents, it is difficult to see how they are misrepresenting any entitlement to exploit them. These causes of action are elusive. It is difficult to escape the view that they have been invoked to provide a more secure jurisdictional footing in this Court than might be available from an action for breach of contract pure and simple. 46 A cause of action arising under the TPA would, by virtue of s 86 of that Act, fall within the jurisdiction of this Court. Where the primary jurisdiction is invoked under the TPA a cause of action in breach of contract arising out of the same factual substratum may fall within the accrued jurisdiction of this Court as part of the same \\\"matter\\\". However, a common law claim in contract does not of itself fall within the jurisdiction of the Court unless, for example, there is some federal law associated with the claim and perhaps deriving from the subject matter of the contract. Where a contract deals with subject matter in the nature of rights owing their existence to federal law may be a matter arising under federal law. So a contract for the assignment of copyright, trade mark rights or patents may be a contract whose breach gives rise to such a matter.    The breaches suspected in this case relate to the obligation of Pursuit Dynamics to provide information relevant to the calculation of royalties to Carnegie and NME and to pay the appropriate royalties. The entitlement is built upon the assignment of rights in part connected with provisional patent specifications comprising the Burns' propulsion technology. It is arguable that there is a connection between such rights and federal law, in this case the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) sufficient to support a contention that the claim of breach of contract is a matter arising under a law of the Commonwealth and thereby within the jurisdiction of the Court under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). I make no concluded finding on that proposition which is not without some difficulty in this case. For present purposes however I assume that jurisdiction is arguable. 47 The threshold question remains whether an application for preliminary discovery is a process of the kind which may be served outside Australia under O 8 of the Federal Court Rules . Order 8, it may be noted, was substantially amended in August 2006. 48 A necessary condition for service of process outside Australia, imposed by O 8 r 2, is that the process concerned be an \\\"originating process\\\". That condition must be met because it is O 8 r 2 that is relied upon by the applicants, rather than O 8 r 4 which provides for the service out of the jurisdiction of documents other than originating process. The question therefore arises whether an application for preliminary discovery is an \\\"originating process\\\" for the purposes of O 8 r 2. 49 Order 8 r 1 defines the originating process as: An application commencing a proceeding, and includes a cross-claim in the proceeding against a person who was not previously a party in the proceeding. The word \\\"proceeding\\\" is not defined in the Rules. However in s 4 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) it is defined thus: \\\" Proceeding \\\" means a proceeding in a court, whether between parties or not, and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connection with, a proceeding, and also includes an appeal. 50 There is no authority to which I have been taken or which I have been able to find directly on the point whether an application for preliminary discovery is an originating process in a proceeding. There is analogous authority in relation to like processes. In Re Sherlock (1991) 102 ALR 156 Lockhart J held that an application for orders that persons be directed to attend before the Court for examination under the provisions of the Corporations Law was not an originating process. In this his Honour followed Re Austral Oil Estates Ltd (in liq) (1986) 86 FLR 247 at 248, a decision of McLelland J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in relation to an examination order under s 541 of the Companies (NSW) Code which was the predecessor of s 597 of the Corporations Law.    In neither of those judgments was there any elaboration of the characterisation of an application for examination as falling outside the concept of \\\"originating process\\\". 51 In Fiorentino v Irons (1997) 79 FCR 327, Foster J declined to follow what he characterised as the obiter observations of Lockhart J in Re Sherlock 102 ALR 156. He noted that the decision in the New South Wales Supreme Court turned upon the precise meaning of the Supreme Court Rules . He made the point that they were not framed in the same way as the Federal Court Rules were at that time. In particular, there was then no definition of \\\"originating process\\\" in either the Federal Court Rules or the Federal Court Act. His Honour relied upon the definition of \\\"proceeding\\\" in the Act. He said it was a very wide definition and he was satisfied that the issue of summons for examination was a proceeding. As to the width of the term \\\"proceeding\\\" his Honour referred to Re Interchase Corporation Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 481 at 487 (Kiefel J) and Pasdale Pty Ltd v Concrete Constructions (1995) 59 FCR 446 at 448 (Finn J). In the latter case Finn J said: The definition of 'proceeding' in the Federal Court of Australia Act s 3 [sic], for example, in its reference to 'an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connexion with, a proceeding', is apt to encompass a motion for security for costs. 52 More recently in Re Strarch International Ltd (in liq) [2005] FCA 829 , Jacobson J held that an examination summons under s 596A of the Corporations Act 2001 was \\\"originating process\\\" within O 8 r 1. It may be noted that at the time his Honour made that decision O 8 r 1 did not define originating process but simply listed the kinds of proceedings in which originating process could be served on a person outside Australia. His Honour followed the reasoning of Foster J in Fiorentino 79 FCR 327 that the different approach which applied in the Supreme Court of New South Wales turned upon the different wording of the rules of that court. He granted leave to the liquidator of the relevant company in that case to serve examination summonses outside the Commonwealth in Malaysia on four named former directors of the company. 53 In my opinion and consistently with the authorities in this Court an application for preliminary discovery is an application in a \\\"proceeding\\\" within the meaning of that word in the Federal Court Act and therefore within the meaning of O 8. An application for preliminary discovery is therefore \\\"an application commencing a proceeding\\\" and is within the new definition of \\\"originating process\\\" in O 8 r 1. 54 The second question is whether or not an application for preliminary discovery is an originating process in one of the kinds of proceedings mentioned in O 8 r 2. The submissions made on behalf of the applicants did not really address this question with any nicety. They seemed rather to proceed on the basis that I should treat the application for preliminary discovery as though it were an application for relief in respect of the possible causes of action to be ascertained by the application for preliminary discovery.    55 The premise upon which preliminary discovery is sought under O 15A r 3 is that the person seeking it, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in the court against that person. And in an application under O 15A r 6 the premise is that there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have a right to obtain relief in the court from a person whose description has been ascertained but the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the court to obtain that relief. The corollary premise is that no proceeding has been commenced in the Court for substantive relief. 56 The applicants in this case assert, for the purposes of O 8 r 2, that their application for preliminary discovery is to be regarded as an originating process in a proceeding which consists of or includes one or more of the following kinds of proceeding set out in O 8 r 2: 1. Proceeding based on a cause of action arising in Australia. 2. Proceeding based on a breach of contract in Australia. 3. Proceeding in relation to a contract that is made on behalf of the person to be served by or through an agent who carries on business in Australia. 4. Proceeding based on a breach of a provision of an Act committed in Australia. 5. Proceeding based on a breach of a provision of an Act (wherever occurring) seeking relief in relation to damage suffered wholly or partly in Australia. 6. Proceeding in which the subject matter, so far as it concerns the person to be served, is property in Australia. 57 In my opinion the proceedings contemplated by the items on which the applicants rely in O 8 r 2 do not include proceedings by way of an application for preliminary discovery. Such proceedings are directed to determine who should be sued and alternatively whether some ascertained person should be served. The proceedings contemplated by the items relied upon in this case, in my opinion, involve originating processes seeking relief in such proceedings. They refer to, in my opinion, claims for substantive relief dependent upon the establishment of the causes of action identified or defined in those items. The applicants' submissions appeared to be posited upon the assumption that the relevant proceedings are those which they might ultimately bring under the TPA and for breach of contract.    But those are not the proceedings which have been commenced in this Court. 58 Order 8 r 2 is to be read subject to O 8 r 3. Order 8 r 3(2), read with O 8 r 3(1), requires, as a necessary condition of leave to serve originating process in a foreign country that the service will be in accordance with a convention or the law of the foreign country. Under O 8 r 3 the evidence on an application for leave under O 8 r 2 must include a statement that the proposed method of service is permitted by the convention where a convention applies or in any other case, by the law of the foreign country. No such statement appears in the evidence in this case. 59 The solicitors for Pursuit Dynamics and Pursuit Marine have written a letter to the Court drawing attention to the Hague Convention on taking Evidence Abroad in Civil and Commercial Matters. That Convention facilitates the transmission and execution of Letters of Request. It is designed to improve mutual judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. The Convention has been ratified by both Australia and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has, it is said, made a declaration under Article 23 with respect to the operation of the Hague Convention in the United Kingdom, that it will not execute Letters of Request issued for the purpose of obtaining pretrial discovery of documents. The Convention is given legislative effect in the United Kingdom by the Evidence (Proceedings in other Jurisdictions) Act 1975 (UK). Relevant courts of the United Kingdom are given power by s 2 of that Act, by order, to make provision for obtaining evidence for the purpose of giving effect to a request in pursuance of which the application for such an order is made. Such orders may make provision, inter alia, for the production of documents. Section 2(4) however provides: An order under this section shall not require a person --- (a) to state what documents relevant to the proceedings to which the application for the order are or have been in his possession, custody or power; or (b) to produce any documents other than particular documents specified in the order as being documents appearing to the court making the order to be, or to be likely to be, in his possession, custody or power. 60 It is not clear with all due respect to the solicitors for the respondents, what bearing that legislation has upon this application. An application for preliminary discovery served on a party in the United Kingdom may be related entirely to documents in the possession, custody or power of that party through agents in Australia. Orders made pursuant to such an application would be enforceable in Australia. Presumably they could only be enforced in respect of documents in the United Kingdom with the assistance of United Kingdom authorities. It may nevertheless be that the policy reflected in the United Kingdom declaration relating to the Hague Convention and s 2(4) of the Evidence (Proceedings in other Jurisdictions) Act would, if not constituting a legal bar to such enforcement, weigh against it as a matter of discretion.    61 Even assuming however that I had the power to order service out of the jurisdiction in this case, it is ultimately concerned with alleged breaches of contract. The governing law clause relied upon by the respondents cannot exclude the jurisdiction of this Court in proceedings arising under the TPA. But where the proceedings are, as a matter of substance, proceedings concerned with an alleged breach of contract then the applicants' express submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in that regard is a powerful factor against the assumption of jurisdiction by this Court. In my opinion, even were I satisfied that I had the power to grant leave to serve the application for preliminary discovery on the respondents in England, I do not think, as a matter of discretion, that I should do so. Conclusion 62 For the preceding reasons the motion will be dismissed. I certify that the preceding sixty-two (62) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French .

It adopts Pt IV and other related sections of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA). 2 The allegations of those contraventions are admitted, as set out in the Defence filed by Messrs Knight and Ross. The ACCC does not press the balance of the allegations of contraventions in the Statement of Claim. 3 Based upon the admissions made by Messrs Knight and Ross, agreement has been reached as to the declaratory relief and other orders, including as to the levels of pecuniary penalties pursuant to s 76 of the Code, to be recommended to the Court as appropriate in relation to the admitted contraventions of the Code. The parties have jointly made submissions as to the appropriate orders the Court should make, based upon the admitted conduct and the relevant background to the contraventions, and upon other matters which the parties contend to be relevant to Court's task. 4 I have been greatly assisted by the joint submissions, much of which is replicated in these reasons. 5 Litigation to establish contraventions such as those admitted by Messrs Knight and Ross can be very complex, time consuming and costly. It is in the public interest for litigation to be concluded in the shortest time frame that is consistent with justice being done between the parties, freeing the ACCC to deal with other matters and reducing the public cost of a lengthy hearing in the Court. Consequently, the Court has encouraged negotiated resolution of proceedings by the ACCC, provided that their terms recognise that the ultimate responsibility for determining the existence of a contravention or contraventions, and as to the proper orders to resolve the proceedings lies with the Court (see Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375; NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285). 6 Accordingly, if the Court is satisfied that there has been a contravention or contraventions as alleged and that the terms of the proposed consent orders are appropriate, it is generally in the public interest for the Court to make orders in terms that have been agreed between parties so as to encourage parties to assist the ACCC in its investigations and to achieve negotiated settlements. 7 The principles governing whether a Court should accept a penalty that has been agreed between the ACCC and a respondent were considered in Trade Practices    Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (No 4) (1981) 37 ALR 256 by Sheppard J, who stated at 259: It is, of course, true that the penalty has been suggested to me by the agreement of the parties. Uninformed of their agreement, I may have selected a different figure, but I am satisfied that it would not have been very different from theirs. There is from time to time, amongst members of the profession and amongst the public, discussion concerning plea bargaining. Sometimes it is suggested that it involves disreputable conduct. It is my opinion that that is so if it at all implicates the court in private discussions as to what the court's attitude will or would be likely to be if a particular course is taken. In this case nothing of that kind has occurred. The parties have made their own agreement and put it to the court for approval, not knowing what its attitude was likely to be. ...  This, of course, is not a criminal case; the liability is civil only. But, even in the most serious criminal cases, it is not unusual for the prosecution to accept a plea to a lesser charge, subject always to the approval of the court. I have said what I have only to explain that the course which the parties have adopted is both proper and not uncommon, even though perhaps novel in the comparatively new field of trade practices. 8 That approach was considered and approved by the Full Federal Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285. In that case, the Court held at 298 --- 299: We agree with the statement made in several of the cases cited that it is not actually useful to investigate whether, unaided by the agreement of the parties, we would have arrived at the very figure they propose. The question is not that; it is simply whether, in the performance of the Court's duty under section 76 , this particular penalty, proposed with the consent of the corporation involved and of the Commission, is one that the Court should determine to be appropriate. 9 The Full Court further stated at 291: There is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case.    10 The Full Court noted (at 290) that generally the most significant and relevant matters that the Court needed to consider about penalty were effects upon the functioning of markets and other economic effects. Although the Court is responsible for determining the appropriate penalty, the Full Court considered that it would be informed by the views of the ACCC about those effects. 11 The decision of the Full Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 was followed by a later Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993. In that case, the Full Court at 48,626 also said that it considered that the following proposition emerged from NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285: ...the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more 'subjective' matters. 12 Further, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 86, at [18], French J said: The question whether an undertaking is to be accepted or a consent order made is not concluded by a finding that it is within the power of the court to do so. The power of the court to make the orders sought is \\\"defined and conferred by public law not by private agreement\\\": Fiss, \\\"Against Settlement\\\" (1984) 93 Yale Law Journal 1073. In the exercise of that power the court is not merely giving effect to the wishes of the parties, it is exercising a public function and must have regard to the public interest in doing so. This principle applies to the resolution of private litigation by consent orders or undertakings. A fortiori it applies to proceedings brought by the Crown or public or statutory authorities to enforce the law in the public interest. The court has a responsibility to be satisfied that what is proposed is not contrary to the public interest and is at least consistent with it ... Consideration of the public interest, however, must also weigh the desirability of non-litigious resolution of enforcement proceedings . (emphasis added). 13 There have been many other decisions of the Court applying those general principles. 14 As I indicated at the close of submissions, I am satisfied that each of the declarations proposed is appropriate and is within power. I am also satisfied that the amount of the proposed pecuniary penalties in each instance and the further proposed order for each of Mr Knight and Mr Ross to attend a trade practices compliance program is appropriate and within power. 15 The following explains why I have reached those conclusions. THE BACKGROUND FACTS (a) The respondents 16 Mr Knight is and was at all material times, a cardiothoracic surgeon practising in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia who offered predominantly, and almost exclusively, cardiac surgical    services at the Flinders Medical Centre (the FMC), Ashford Hospital (Ashford) and Flinders Private Hospital (Flinders Private). He also is and was at all material times the head of the cardiac unit at the FMC, an Associate Professor of Surgery at Flinders University and was, from about November 2000 to about March 2003, a member of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons' (RACS) Board of Cardiothoracic Surgery. From 2002 to 2004, Mr Knight was Vice-President of the Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons and from 2004 to 2005 was its President. 17 Mr Ross is and was at all material times, a cardiothoracic surgeon also practising in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia who offered predominantly, and almost exclusively, cardiac surgical services at the FMC, Ashford and Flinders Private. Mr Ross was also at all material times a senior cardiac surgeon at the FMC and was, from June 2000, Clinical Advisor, Cardiothoracic Surgery at Adelaide Community Healthcare Alliance Inc (ACHA), which at all material times owned Ashford and Flinders Private. Mr Ross was also President of the Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons between 1999 and 2000. 18 The conduct by Messrs Knight and Ross involving the contravention of the Code related to Mr Craig Jurisevic (Mr Jurisevic) and Mr James Edwards (Mr Edwards), cardiothoracic surgeons in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia. 19 By about 1 January 2001, Mr Jurisevic had obtained the necessary formal qualifications to be entitled to practise as a cardiothoracic surgeon in that he had been admitted as a Fellow with effect from 1 January 2001. Mr Jurisevic's official supervisor during the final year of his RACS Advanced Surgical Training in cardiothoracic surgery (which is part of the training required to be a cardiothoracic surgeon) was Mr Knight. Mr Ross also supervised Mr Jurisevic's surgery during that period. 20 Mr Edwards was admitted as a Fellow in 1997 and since about July 2003, he has been the Director of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Unit of the Royal Adelaide Hospital (Royal Adelaide). (b) The market 21 Cardiothoracic surgical services are vital for patients who need them. By reason of the matters referred to below, barriers to entry to the market for the supply of cardiothoracic surgical services are high. 22 Demand for cardiac surgical services, including open heart surgery, comes from adult members of the public with an acquired or congenital disease or disorder of the heart. Of the 7 to 8 cardiothoracic surgeons practising in the Adelaide metropolitan area during the relevant period, only 1 to 2 of those surgeons predominantly provided thoracic surgical services. No services were or are substitutable for cardiothoracic surgical services. Patients requiring cardiothoracic surgical services would either be public patients (where facilities and the surgical services are provided by the State) or private patients    (where facilities and the surgical services are usually paid for by the patient either directly or through their medical insurer). 23 The usual means by which patients obtained cardiac surgical services was firstly for the patient to obtain a referral from a general practitioner to a cardiologist. If the cardiologist considered that cardiac surgery may be appropriate, the cardiologist would then refer the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon. 24 Cardiac surgical services could only be provided in South Australia by cardiothoracic surgeons at hospitals which had: (1) a specialised operating theatre as well as specialised personnel to support and assist the cardiothoracic surgeon and provide post-operative care (the necessary facilities); and (2) a licence under the South Australian Health Commission Act 1976 (SA) in order to permit cardiothoracic surgeons to provide cardiac surgical services at the hospital (licence). Such licences at the private hospitals Ashford, Flinders Private and Wakefield Hospital (Wakefield) were conditional upon each cardiothoracic surgeon providing cardiac surgical services also having held a formal appointment at a South Australian public teaching hospital, namely the FMC or the Royal Adelaide (licence condition). 25 For patients residing in or near South Australia, the nearest available cardiothoracic surgeons operated in the Adelaide metropolitan area where hospitals having the necessary facilities and licence were located. Those patients generally travelled to Adelaide for cardiothoracic surgical services. 26 The only hospitals in South Australia which had both the necessary facilities and a licence were Wakefield, Ashford, the FMC, Flinders Private and Royal Adelaide. 27 Private patients generally accepted the recommendation of their cardiologists as to the cardiothoracic surgeon they would engage. The cardiologist would recommend private patients to cardiothoracic surgeons based upon the following principal factors: (1) the reputation and standing of the available cardiothoracic surgeons for the type of surgery involved; (2) the quality of the referring cardiologist's working relationship with the available cardiothoracic surgeons; (3) whether a cardiothoracic surgeon performed surgery in a hospital at which the referring cardiologist preferred to consult; and (4) the quality of the necessary facilities at the hospital or hospitals at which a cardiothoracic surgeon had obtained accreditation. 28 The provision of thoracic surgical services in South Australia by a cardiothoracic surgeon did not require an operating theatre or personnel specialised to the same degree as that required for cardiac surgical services. Nor was a licence, with conditions similar to that required for the provision of cardiac surgery, required in order to permit cardiothoracic surgeons to provide thoracic surgical services at a hospital in South Australia. (c) Cardiothoracic surgeons 29 Cardiothoracic surgeons provide cardiac surgical services or thoracic surgical services or both. To offer services as a cardiothoracic surgeon to private patients in South Australia, a person must have: (1) obtained qualifications in Australia by: (a) attaining the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (or their equivalent), which takes approximately 6 years; (b) completing the RACS Basic Surgical Training program, which takes approximately a further 2 years; and (c) completing the RACS    Advanced Surgical Training program in cardiothoracic surgery under the supervision of cardiothoracic surgeons, which takes approximately a further 6 years; or (2) been trained overseas to an appropriate and equivalent level, to the satisfaction of RACS; and (3) been admitted to, and gained fellowship of, RACS; and (4) obtained specialist registration as a cardiothoracic surgeon from the Medical Board of South Australia; and (5) been extended the right, benefit or privilege of providing cardiac surgical services, thoracic surgical services or both, as appropriate, (accreditation) by each hospital with the necessary facilities at which he or she proposed to provide the relevant services; and (6) have theatre time allocated to him or her at each hospital at which he or she had accreditation in South Australia and which had the necessary facilities and licence. 30 Additionally, the provision of cardiac surgical services by a cardiothoracic surgeon was dependent upon the cardiothoracic surgeon holding an appointment at a public teaching hospital in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia, namely the FMC or the Royal Adelaide, where he or she provided cardiac surgical services, as a result of the condition attached to the private hospital licence. 31 A cardiothoracic surgeon needed to provide enough cardiac surgical services to maintain a sufficient level of competence. 32 In order for a person to gain admission to, and fellowship of, RACS, favourable references were required from each of the person's supervising cardiothoracic surgeons as nominated by RACS. Also, both accreditation at private hospitals, and gaining an appointment at a public teaching hospital in South Australia was, for a newly admitted Fellow, greatly assisted by favourable references from the supervising cardiothoracic surgeons involved with his or her training. 33 It is usual for persons, after being admitted as Fellows, to spend an additional one to two years in an overseas placement before returning to a consultant position in Australia. Although usual, however, it is not a requirement for newly admitted Fellows to undertake an overseas placement in order to provide services in the market. (d) Competition between cardiothoracic surgeons 34 During the period from the opening of the cardiac operating theatre at Ashford in or about 1991 until in or about July 2005 only cardiothoracic surgeons who held an appointment at the FMC from time to time provided cardiac surgical services at Ashford. 35 During the period from the opening of the cardiac operating theatre at Wakefield in or about 1994 until in or about the date of these submissions only cardiothoracic surgeons who held an appointment at the Royal Adelaide from time to time provided cardiac surgical services at Wakefield. 36 In those circumstances, I am satisfied that (as the ACCC alleges, and Mr Ross and Mr Knight admit) during the period of the conduct there was a market for the provision of cardiothoracic surgical services to private patients living in and near South Australia (the market). THE ADMITTED CONDUCT OF MESSRS KNIGHT AND ROSS Conduct in relation to Mr Jurisevic 37 In 2000, Mr Jurisevic was a cardiothoracic registrar at the FMC, working with Messrs Knight and Ross whilst completing his training to become a Fellow.    Mr Knight proposed that upon becoming a Fellow, Mr Jurisevic would continue to work with them as a senior registrar at the FMC through 2001, then undertake in 2002 a cardiothoracic surgery placement for approximately 18 months at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Mr Knight subsequently received confirmation from the Brigham and Women's Hospital that Mr Jurisevic would be considered for such a placement. Mr Jurisevic accepted the senior registrar's position for 2001. 38 In the course of Mr Jurisevic's final year of RACS Advanced Surgical Training, Mr Knight provided a positive reference to RACS about Mr Jurisevic's surgical competency and gave positive assessments concerning Mr Jurisevic, which included that Mr Jurisevic had impressive operative technique and that he would make an excellent surgeon in the future. 39 Mr Jurisevic completed his RACS Advanced Surgical Training program and was admitted as a Fellow with effect from 1 January 2001. 40 Following Mr Jurisevic's admission as a Fellow, in January 2001 he commenced a 12 month senior registrar's position at the FMC, operating on public patients. 41 On or about 6 February 2001, Mr Jurisevic told Messrs Knight and Ross that he did not want to undertake an 18 month overseas placement, and that he intended to commence offering cardiothoracic surgical service, specialising in thoracic surgical services to private patients in Adelaide. 42 On or about 6 February 2001, Messrs Knight and Ross made an arrangement, a provision of which included that Messrs Knight and Ross would hinder or prevent Mr Jurisevic entering or supplying cardiothoracic surgical services in the market prior to his gaining further cardiothoracic surgical training (the provision). 43 The provision referred to in the preceding paragraph was likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market in that that provision and the giving effect to that provision: (1) signalled to newly admitted Fellows of the RACS that they may need a further period of clinical training before entering the market; and (2) raised the barriers to entry into the market by unilaterally imposing, as a condition for entry into the market, the requirement that newly admitted Fellows undertake a further period of clinical training. 44 A further effect of the provision referred to in [42] was that Mr Jurisevic was hindered from obtaining accreditation at Ashford for a period of time. 45 On or about 9 February 2001, Mr Jurisevic obtained his specialist registration as a cardiothoracic surgeon from the Medical Board of South Australia. On or about that day, Mr Jurisevic resigned from his senior registrar position. 46 On or about 14 February 2001, Mr Jurisevic applied for accreditation at ACHA hospitals (the accreditation application) in which he nominated Mr David Robert Craddock (Mr Craddock), a cardiothoracic surgeon and the then Director of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Unit at the Royal Adelaide, and Mr John Stubberfield (Mr Stubberfield), a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Royal Adelaide, as referees. Both Mr Craddock and Mr Stubberfield had been supervisors of Mr Jurisevic during his training.    47 Messrs Knight and Ross gave effect to the arrangement referred to in [42] above by engaging in the following conduct. 48 In or about February 2001, Mr Knight had a conversation with Dr Christopher Baggoley (Dr Baggoley), the then Consultant Medical Director at ACHA, in Dr Baggoley's office at Ashford. Dr Baggoley was a member of the Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) at Ashford which considered applications for accreditation. In that conversation, Mr Knight said words to the effect that Mr Jurisevic should not be extended accreditation by ACHA as it would be unsafe for patients if Mr Jurisevic operated independently because he was not ready; and that Mr Jurisevic required further supervision before becoming an independent surgeon. 49 In or about February 2001, Mr Ross also had a conversation with Dr Baggoley in Dr Baggoley's office at Ashford in which he said words to the effect that Mr Jurisevic should not be extended accreditation by ACHA as it would be unsafe for patients if Mr Jurisevic operated independently because he was not ready; and that Mr Jurisevic required further supervision before becoming an independent surgeon; 50 Then, in or about mid-February 2001, Mr Knight had a conversation with Mr Craddock in which he said words to the effect that Mr Jurisevic had not finished his training. 51 By letter dated 20 February 2001, Mr Ross replied in writing to a query from Dr Andrew Sutherland, Chief (Medical), Division of Paediatric Surgery at the Women's & Children's Hospital in Adelaide where Mr Morris Peacock, a cardiothoracic surgeon who exclusively provided thoracic surgical services, had requested that Mr Jurisevic be extended accreditation. The letter included statements to the effect that Messrs Knight and Ross considered that Mr Jurisevic was very undertrained to provide thoracic surgical services at the Women's & Children's Hospital; that they had grave reservations about Mr Jurisevic going into private practice; and that they felt that it would be entirely inappropriate to have Mr Jurisevic hold any sort of position at the Women's & Children's Hospital. 52 By letter dated 28 February 2001, Mr Knight wrote to Mr Ross (with the consent of Mr Ross) in the latter's capacity as Clinical Advisor, Cardiothoracic Surgery at ACHA; for the purpose of submission to the MAC, and so that the MAC could consider the letter in relation to the accreditation application. That letter included statements to the effect that Mr Knight's opinion was that Mr Jurisevic was not equipped at that moment to perform to an appropriate level without supervision and guidance; and that patients may, during unsupervised surgery performed by Mr Jurisevic, be subjected to greater risk than would otherwise be the case; 53 By letter dated 27 February 2001, Mr Craddock had written to ACHA regarding the accreditation application recommending that Mr Jurisevic be extended accreditation; 54 In or about March 2001, Mr Knight had a conversation with Mr Craddock about the reference provided by Mr Craddock in his letter of 27 February 2001. During that conversation, Mr Knight said words to the effect that he was surprised that Mr Craddock had given the reference; and that he (Mr Knight) had enormous concerns about Mr Jurisevic's competency to act in an unsupervised fashion; 55 Prior to 9 March    2001, Mr Knight, Mr Ross, Mr Stubberfield and Dr Robert Craig (Dr Craig), the then Clinical Director of the Department of Cardiovascular Services at the Royal Adelaide, met at Dr Craig's rooms at Kent Town. During that meeting, Messrs Knight and Ross said words to the effect that Mr Stubberfield should agree to withdraw his support for Mr Jurisevic and not provide a reference for Mr Jurisevic; that Mr Jurisevic was not adequately trained; and that Mr Jurisevic was not competent to take on private practice. 56 Despite those various imprecations, on about 6 May 2001 RACS' Board of Cardiothoracic Surgery confirmed at a meeting of the Board, at which Mr Ross was present, that newly admitted Fellows, such as Mr Jurisevic, were legally entitled to practise independently. Conduct in relation to Mr Edwards 57 In about January 2003 Mr Edwards commenced practising in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia as a cardiothoracic surgeon at Royal Adelaide and Wakefield. In about July 2003, Mr Edwards became the Director of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Unit of the Royal Adelaide. 58 On or about 19 March 2003 Mr Edwards applied for accreditation as a cardiothoracic surgeon at ACHA hospitals which included Ashford, and by 5 May 2003, Messrs Knight and Ross had become aware of Mr Edwards' application. 59 That apparently prompted Mr Ross to write to Mr Edwards by letter dated 5 May 2003. The letter was copied to Mr Stubberfield and Dr Craig. The letter informed Mr Edwards that there was an existing arrangement between those cardiothoracic surgeons who held an appointment at the Royal Adelaide and those cardiothoracic surgeons who held an appointment at the FMC whereby the former surgeons would not seek to operate on private patients at Ashford and the latter would not seek to operate on private patients at Wakefield (the non-compete arrangement). It invited Mr Edwards to become a party to the non-compete arrangement. 60 It also threatened Mr Edwards that Messrs Knight and Ross would seek to operate at Wakefield unless Mr Edwards agreed not to seek to compete with them at Ashford. 61 I am satisfied that, by reason of that conduct, Mr Ross attempted to make an arrangement with Mr Edwards containing provisions to the effect that: (1) Mr Edwards would not supply cardiothoracic surgical services to patients at Ashford in competition with Mr Ross; and (2) Mr Ross would not supply cardiothoracic surgical services to patients at Wakefield in competition with Mr Edwards. 62 I am also satisfied by reason of these matters that the attempted arrangement contained provisions which would have been likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market in that, if the arrangement were made, Mr Edwards and Mr Ross would have been prevented from supplying cardiothoracic surgical services in competition with each other at Ashford and at Wakefield respectively. 63 By letter dated 23 November 2004 Mr Knight also wrote to Mr Edwards. His letter included statements to the effect that: • there had been long held agreements in Adelaide about utilisation of the two axes for cardiac surgery with the Royal Adelaide    - Wakefield axis and the FMC - Ashford axis; • it was Mr Knight's belief that Mr Edwards' decision to go to Ashford was disruptive to well established practice patterns in Adelaide; and • Mr Edwards' decision to go to Ashford was expressly against the wishes of Messrs Knight and Ross. In essence, his letter reminded Mr Edwards of the non-compete arrangement; and invited Mr Edwards to become a party to the non-compete arrangement. 64 By reason of that conduct I am also satisfied that Mr Knight attempted to make an arrangement with Mr Edwards containing provisions to the effect that: (1) Mr Edwards would not supply cardiothoracic surgical services to patients at Ashford in competition with Mr Knight; and (2) Mr Knight would not supply cardiothoracic surgical services to patients at Wakefield in competition with Mr Edwards. I am also satisfied by reason of those matters that the attempted arrangement contained provisions which would have been likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market in that, if the arrangement were made, Mr Edwards and Mr Knight would have been prevented from supplying cardiothoracic surgical services in competition with each other at Ashford and at Wakefield respectively. ORDERS 65 The Court has a wide discretion under section 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to make binding declarations of right (see, for example: Trade Practices Commission v Santos Limited (1993) ATPR 41-221; Tobacco Institute of Australia Limited v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 89; RAIA Insurance Brokers Limited v FAI General Insurance Co Limited (1993) 41 FCR 164; Australian Competition & Consumer Commission v Target (2001) ATPR 41-840 at [14]). The proposed declarations go to the legal controversy between the parties ( Ainsworth and Anor v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 596) and the ACCC has a \\\"real interest\\\", as that expression was used in Forster v Jododex Aust Pty Limited [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437 --- 438, in seeking declaratory relief as the public body charged with enforcing the TPA and the Code (see Australian Competition & Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-801 at [30]). 66 In the light of those findings, I consider it appropriate to make declarations in the terms proposed by the parties. The matters they address are far from hypothetical, and the proposed declarations specifically address the particular contravening conduct on the part of Mr Knight and Mr Ross which has been established: see Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53. 67 Section 86C of the TPA contains the power to order a contravenor of a provision of the TPA to attend a compliance program. The text of the Code includes that (and other) provisions of the TPA which relate to the Schedule version of Part IV: see s 4(1)(b) of the Competition Policy Reform (South Australia) Act 1996 (SA). The proposed order that each of Mr Knight and Mr Ross attend a trade practices compliance program is therefore within power.    As it is agreed that their contravening conduct was engaged in ignorance of the relevant provisions of the Code, it is appropriate that they should attend such a program provided it is relevant to the contraventions. The proposed order satisfies that proviso and is sufficiently clear and precise to enable the performance of it to be readily undertaken and assessed. 68 The proposed orders for costs are also clearly within the Court's power and are appropriate. 69 Finally, there is the greater question of the appropriate amount of the pecuniary penalties. Assessment of an appropriate penalty 70 Section 76 of the Code and of the TPA sets out matters to which the Court must have regard in determining an appropriate level of penalty. The principles are generally equally relevant to the assessment of a pecuniary penalty under the Code. They were addressed by French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152 - 52,153. French J, dealing with a corporation not an individual, formulated these as follows: (a) the nature and extent of the contravening conduct; (b) the amount of loss or damage caused; (c) the circumstances in which the conduct took place; (d) the size of the contravening company; (e) the degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; (f) the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended; (g) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level; (h) whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and (i) whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention. 71 Those considerations were approved and expanded upon by the Full Court of the Federal Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 and by Heerey J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee & Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-628 to include: (a) whether the person has previously been found by the Court to have engaged in similar conduct (a matter required to be taken into account by section 76); (b) the effect on the functioning of the market and other economic effects of the conduct; (c) the financial position of the contravening company; and (d) whether the conduct was systematic, deliberate or covert. 72 I must of course be mindful that the respondents are individuals carrying on business, rather than corporate entities, so the penalty factors set out above must be adapted, where possible, to the circumstances of the respondents . I also bear in mind, as Burchett J pointed out in Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375 at 40,169, that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved (the 'totality principle' as known in the criminal law).    73 It has long been accepted that a principal object of a penalty under s 76 is deterrence (see Trade Practices Commission v Stihl Chain Saws (Aust) Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR 40-091 at 17,896 per Smithers J). In Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152, French J stated: The principal, and I think probably the only, object of the penalties imposed by s. 76 is to attempt to put a price on contravention that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act. This approach was approved by the majority of the Full Federal Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 . 74 Deterrence has two aspects: specific deterrence in respect of the actual contravener and general deterrence of others \\\"who may be disposed to engage in prohibited conduct of a similar kind\\\" ( Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 298, per Toohey J). The Full Court in NW Frozen Foods 71 FCR 285 made it clear (at 294-295) that: The Court should not leave room for any impression of weakness in its resolve to impose penalties sufficient to ensure the deterrence, not only of the parties actually before it, but also of others who might be tempted to think that contravention would pay ... 75 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) (2005) 215 ALR 301, Goldberg J concluded at [39] that: The penalty imposed must be substantial enough that the party realises the seriousness of its conduct and is not inclined to repeat such conduct. Obviously the sum required to achieve this object will be larger where the Court is setting a penalty for a company with vast resources. However, as specific deterrence is only one element and general deterrence must also be achieved, consideration of the party's capacity to pay must be weighed against the need to impose a sum which members of the public will recognise as significant and proportionate to the seriousness of the contravention. 76 In applying the above principles to the conduct of each respondent, and having regard to all the factors and circumstances including those outlined below, the ACCC and Messrs Knight and Ross submit that penalties in the following amounts are appropriate, and are within the range of penalties a Court would order in the circumstances: Mr Knight: \\$55,000 Mr Ross: \\$55,000 I consider that those proposed penalties are within the range of penalties which might properly be imposed for the contraventions. 77 I will briefly set out my reasons for that conclusion, in the light of the matters discussed in the cases referred to. 78 The conduct in relation to Mr Jurisevic came about because, in early February 2001, he indicated to Messrs Knight and Ross that he did not wish to take up the training position at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and that he intended to commence offering cardiothoracic surgical services, specialising in thoracic surgical services, to private patients in Adelaide. Subsequently, Mr Jurisevic resigned from his senior registrar position at the FMC, three weeks into his 12 month appointment. This upset Messrs Knight and Ross.    79 The 2001 conduct involved making an arrangement in February 2001 and giving effect to it in February and March 2001. The arrangement contained a provision to the effect that Messrs Knight and Ross would hinder or prevent Mr Jurisevic entering or supplying cardiothoracic surgical services in the market in the absence of and prior to his gaining further cardiothoracic surgical training. It is admitted that this had the likely effect of substantially lessening competition in the market because it signalled to newly admitted Fellows that they would probably need further clinical training before entering the market and thereby raised barriers to entry. It also hindered Mr Jurisevic from gaining accreditation at Ashford for a period of time. 80 The 2001 conduct was not accidental but it was influenced by Messrs Knight and Ross's belief as to the appropriate training and experience required for a cardiothoracic surgeon in private practice. The ACCC accepts that their belief was genuinely held. Nonetheless, Messrs Knight and Ross, in their dealings with hospitals and fellow cardiothoracic surgeons, went beyond merely expressing a view that further training was, in their opinion, desirable for newly admitted Fellows in the manner described above. Moreover, at the time of the conduct there were only 7 or 8 cardiothoracic surgeons in the market with Messrs Knight and Ross both being senior and highly influential members of the cardiac units at the hospitals at which they held appointments or accreditation. Both had supervised Mr Jurisevic during the final years of his RACS Advanced Surgical Training program. Their recommendations in respect of Mr Jurisevic were accordingly likely to be influential with hospitals and peers. 81 The conduct in relation to Mr Edwards in 2003 and 2004 was also (as the ACCC accepts) influenced by Messrs Knight's and Ross' belief that it was beneficial to patients that cardiac surgeons work as a team in dedicated cardiac units with support personnel who are experienced and familiar with each other and the particular surgeons' procedures, practices and protocols. 82 In addition, Messrs Knight and Ross were supportive of the non-compete arrangement as they believed it accorded with a 1998 report to the South Australian Health Commission which recommended that there should be two axes for the provision of cardiac surgical services in Adelaide: a northern axis whereby patients from northern regions requiring cardiac surgery would be operated on at Royal Adelaide and Wakefield; and a southern axis whereby patients from southern regions would go to FMC and Ashford for cardiac surgery. It was recommended that adopting these axes would, among other things, be a means of ensuring that there would be a sufficient population base to sustain two viable cardiac units (including both public and private services) in Adelaide. The report did not, however, suggest that cardiothoracic surgeons should only operate within a single axis, or should not hold appointments or accreditation in both axes.    83 The 2003 and 2004 conduct involved, in each case, the sending of the letters of 5 May 2003 by Mr Ross and of 23 November 2004 by Mr Knight referred to above to Mr Edwards in an attempt to have Mr Edwards become a party to the non-compete arrangement by Mr Edwards agreeing not to provide cardiothoracic surgical services to private patients at Ashford and Messrs Ross and Knight agreeing to refrain from providing cardiothoracic surgical services at Wakefield where Mr Edwards was then providing services (as an adjunct to his public work at the Royal Adelaide). Mr Edwards refused to enter into the arrangement. If he had agreed, it is admitted that the resulting arrangement would have been likely to have had the effect of substantially lessening competition in the market. 84 It is not possible to quantify any loss or damage caused by the 2001 conduct. Mr Jurisevic commenced in private cardiothoracic practice in about February 2001, performing his first operation in March 2001. He was accredited as a cardiothoracic surgeon providing thoracic surgical services at Ashford in July 2001 and secured a public hospital appointment as a cardiothoracic surgeon in 2003. 85 However, an ongoing effect of the conduct was that the barriers to entry to the market for cardiothoracic surgical services to private patients were likely to have been raised. As a result of Messrs Knight and Ross' conduct, newly qualified cardiothoracic surgeons in Adelaide were likely to consider they were in effect required to undertake further training, overseas or interstate, in order to practise as a cardiothoracic surgeon, notwithstanding their admission as a Fellow and registration as a cardiothoracic specialist. The conclusion of these proceedings will serve to ameliorate any such ongoing effect of the conduct. 86 The 2003 and 2004 conduct involved only attempted contraventions, and did not therefore involve actual loss or damage, but is nevertheless serious. 87 It should however be observed that the anticompetitive conduct provisions in the TPA were extended in 1996 to apply to individuals in the health sector in South Australia as a result of the enactment of the Code by the Competition Policy Reform (South Australia) Act 1996 (SA). Mr Knight and Mr Ross had little knowledge of the TPA or Code and did not know that the admitted conduct constituted a breach of the Code. Their conduct was not covert. The conduct was accordingly deliberate only in the sense of not being accidental or involuntary and was not in knowing contravention of the law. The respondents have consented to an order that they undergo appropriate training so that contraventions can be identified and avoided in the future. 88 Messrs Knight and Ross have co-operated with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Code in relation to the contraventions. They have saved the Court's and the ACCC's time by making the admissions and in reaching agreement with the ACCC on these joint submissions.    The time and cost of pursuing these proceedings would otherwise have been very significant. Accordingly, the proposed penalties for Mr Knight and Mr Ross should include a significant discount from those that the Court might otherwise consider appropriate absent such co-operation. 89 Finally, I note that the proposed penalties are within the resources of Mr Knight and Mr Ross and that neither of them has previously been found to have contravened the TPA or the Code. CONCLUSION 90 For those reasons, I propose to make the orders proposed jointly by the parties. I certify that the preceding ninety (90) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield.

INTERLOCUTORY RELIEF On 7 June 2007, in response to CIHL's claim for interlocutory relief, I made an order pursuant to subs 191(5) of the Act that the need for compliance with para (c) of subs 191(2) of the Act, in so far as it requires an approved summary of the Scheme to be given to owners of policies issued by CIHL for whom CIHL has no record of a current mailing address, be dispensed with. I made the order in [2] for reasons including the following: (1) On 2 April 2007 CIHL sent an approved summary of the Scheme, together with a covering letter to 1,592 CIHL policyholders referrable to CIHL's SF1. There were only three CIHL policyholders for whom CIHL had no current address details and to whom the approved summary of the Scheme was not sent. (2) The evidence of the return mail procedures adopted by CIHL as detailed in [36] of Ex. 2. Accordingly, I formed the view that the dispensation relief sought in respect of the three policyholders of CIHL for whom no current address was available was appropriate. On 7 June 2007 in response to CMLA's claim for interlocutory relief, I made an order pursuant to subs 191(5) of the Act that the need for compliance with para (c) of subs 191(2) of the Act, in so far as it requires an approved summary of the Scheme to be given to owners of policies issued by CMLA referrable to CMLA's SF3, be dispensed with. I made the order in [5] for reasons including the following: (1) The Scheme does not alter the policy terms or conditions of CMLA policyholders referrable to SF3. (2) No changes are proposed under the Scheme to the current basis of managing the business of CMLA's SF3. (3) The interests of CMLA's SF3 policyholders have been considered by the actuaries, including the independent actuary. In short, the Scheme does not prejudice, or materially affect, CMLA's policyholders referrable to SF3.    (4) The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ('APRA') has indicated that it has no objection to the dispensation relief sought by the applicants, and has no objection to the Scheme itself. (5) The applicants have widely advertised the proposed Scheme and the intended confirmation application in newspapers throughout Australia. The notice advised policyholders where they may inspect or obtain copies of the Scheme. The advertising programme was approved by APRA. (6) Details of the Scheme have been placed on the Comminsure website. Copies of the Scheme have been sent to policyholders upon request, free of charge. Accordingly, I formed the view that the dispensation relief sought in respect of CMLA's SF3 policyholders was appropriate. THE SUBSTANTIVE APPLICATION Introduction CIHL and CMLA are both registered life insurance companies. CMLA is a subsidiary of CIHL and CIHL is ultimately owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. CIHL operates through a single statutory fund, SF1, and its portfolio of non-participating term certain annuity policies is closed to new business. CMLA operates six statutory funds, including its annuity business conducted through SF3, which in turn has a number of sub-funds. CMLA's SF3 is open to new business. Once confirmed, the Scheme is intended to take effect from 11.59 p.m. on 30 June 2007 ('the Transfer Date'). The Court's Discretion Under s 194 of the Act, the Court has a discretion to confirm the Scheme, with or without modification, or to refuse to confirm it. Whilst the Court's discretion is broad, it is not unfettered, and must be exercised on the evidence and having regard to the objects of the Act, principally, the protection of the interests of policyholders and prospective policyholders (s 3(1) of the Act). See Colonial Portfolio Services Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (2000) 11 ANZ Ins Cas 90-103; [1999] FCA 1779 at [4] and [29]. There are two aspects to the protection of the interests of policyholders: 1. First, there are the procedural aspects in which the Court is concerned to see that the process undertaken has been properly executed in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the Life Insurance Regulations 1995 (Cth) ('the Regulations'); and 2. Second, there is a substantive aspect in which the Court is concerned to see that the Scheme will not be prejudicial to the interests of policyholders and that policyholders are properly safeguarded, i.e., there is not likely to be any material detriment to policyholders affected by the Scheme (see NuLife Insurance Ltd v Norwich Union Life Australia Ltd [2005] FCA 1635 at [24] per Emmett J; MLC Lifetime Company Ltd & Anor (No. 2) [2006] FCA 1367 at [5] per Bennett J; Colonial Portfolio at [25] per Mathews J) The question of whether policyholders would be adversely affected by the Scheme is largely    actuarial and involves a comparison of their security and reasonable expectations without the Scheme with what they would be if the Scheme were implemented. Procedural Requirements The affidavit evidence in relation to compliance with the necessary procedural requirements establishes the following matters: (1) That a copy of the Scheme and the actuarial report of Ms Jennifer Lang (the appointed actuary of CIHL and CMLA), being the report on which the Scheme was founded, and the report of Mr Clive Aaron (the independent actuary), were given to APRA on 5 and 13 March 2007 respectively, in compliance with subs 191(2)(a) of the Act. (2) That notice of the intention to make this application, in the form approved by APRA, was published on 2 April 2007 in the Gazette and in newspapers, approved by APRA, circulating in each State and Territory in which there is a register of life policies for the applicants, in compliance with subs 191(2)(b) of the Act and Reg 9.02(1) of the Regulations. (3) A correction notice, in the form approved by APRA, was published in Tasmanian newspapers on 13 April 2007. (4) That for a period of 15 days after publication of the notice, the Scheme was open to inspection on each of these registries by any policyholder of the applicants. (5) No persons attended at the advertised locations to inspect a copy of the Scheme, and only one person requested a copy of the Scheme by letter. (6) Two telephone calls were received by the call centre established by the applicants to answer queries relating to the Scheme and one call was received by Freehills, the applicants' solicitors. (7) Two persons made an email request for a copy of the Scheme and were sent a copy as requested. (8) No person has advised Freehills that they intend to object to the Scheme. (9) That an approved summary of the Scheme has been given to every affected policy owner other than those in respect of whom dispensation with a need for compliance with subs 191(2)(c) of the Act was given by the Court on 7 June 2007, namely: (i) Those policyholders of CIHL for whom CIHL has no record of a current address (being three policyholders); and (ii) Those policyholders of CMLA whose policies are referrable to CMLA's SF3. Substantive Matters The Scheme The Scheme comprises the Scheme and a scheme deed between CIHL and CMLA dated 28 May 2007 ('the Scheme Deed'), to which details of the Scheme are annexed. The effect of the Scheme is that the whole of the life insurance business of CIHL's SF1 will be amalgamated with the life insurance business of CMLA's SF3, in particular, the superannuation non-participating term certain annuity sub-fund of CMLA's SF3. To this end, on the Transfer Date, CMLA will acquire all assets and assume all liabilities of CIHL's SF1, other than current tax liabilities of SF1 to 30 June 2007 and an amount represented by the provisions set aside to meet such liabilities. Thus, on the Transfer Date CIHL's policies will be transferred from SF1 (with net assets of \\$94 million as at 31 December 2006) to a significantly larger and more diverse portfolio of business of CMLA's SF3 (net assets of \\$1,657 million as at 31 December 2006).    The only change to CIHL's Scheme policies is that references to CIHL will be read as references to CMLA, and references to a statutory fund of CIHL are to be read as references to CMLA's SF3. The Scheme does not change the policy terms and conditions of existing CMLA policyholders referrable to SF3, and no changes are proposed under the Scheme to the current basis of managing the business of CMLA's SF3. The Scheme does not affect CMLA's other statutory funds. All costs of the Scheme will be met by CMLA's Shareholders Fund. Effect on Policyholders The effect of the Scheme upon policyholders of each of the applicants is dealt with in the actuarial report of Ms Lang dated March 2007 assisted by the views of two other in-house actuaries, who have considered the separate interests of policyholders of CIHL and CMLA. The actuarial report sets out the commercial background to the proposed merger of the life insurance business of CIHL with CMLA. In summary, the actuary has concluded that: (1) There is no change to the benefits or future expectations of the policyholders of either company. (2) Equity is maintained between the existing policyholders of CMLA and those being transferred from CIHL. (3) Adequate security of policyholder benefits should be maintained. (4) The amalgamation is in the interests of policyholders of both companies. (5) The amalgamation is in the interests of shareholders. The independent actuary, Mr Aaron, has considered the impact of the Scheme on the security and benefit expectations of policyholders and has concluded that: (1) The benefit expectations of CIHL and CMLA policyholders will not be adversely affected by the Scheme; and (2) the Scheme should not materially affect the security of CIHL and CMLA policyholders. APRA The consent of APRA to the Scheme is not required under the Act, but APRA has indicated that it does not object to the Scheme. Insurance Acquisition and Takeovers Act 1991 (Cth) The terms of the Scheme Deed give rise to the need for the applicants to obtain the Minister's approval of a 'trigger proposal' under s 36(c) of the Insurance Acquisition and Takeovers Act 1991 (Cth) ('the IATA'), as CMLA is acquiring greater than 15 per cent of the total book net liabilities of CIHL's contracts of life insurance. That approval was sought on 30 May 2007. The Assistant Treasurer's 'go ahead' decision was given by letter dated 27 June 2007. Other Matters The last audit reports for CIHL and CMLA as at 30 June 2006 demonstrate net assets as follows: CIHL CMLA Net assets \\$6,897 m \\$1,298 m The financial position of both applicants continues to be reflected in the most recent management accounts to 30 April 2007 which record the following: CIHL CMLA Net assets \\$6,208 m \\$1,141 m The approved actuary, Ms Lang, has confirmed that: (1) There have been no material changes in circumstances since preparing her actuarial report that would affect the opinions expressed in that report; (2) there has been no    material change in circumstances in CIHL or CMLA since 31 May 2007 that would adversely affect their solvency and capital adequacy positions; and (3) she is not aware of any matters or events that would adversely affect those positions between the date of her second affidavit, sworn 22 June 2007, and the proposed Transfer Date in respect of the Scheme, namely, 30 June 2007. On 27 June 2007 I made an order pursuant to s 194 of the Act confirming the Scheme and in doing so took into account matters including the following matters: (1) There has been compliance will all legislative requirements under the Act and Regulations. (2) The objective of the Scheme is to integrate and consolidate the life insurance business of CIHL and CMLA, and it does so in a manner which does not change the benefits or future expectations of policyholders of either company. (3) Adequate security of policyholder benefits should be maintained. (4) The amalgamation is in the interests of policyholders of both CIHL and CMLA and is in the interests of shareholders. (5) APRA has independently considered the Scheme and has no objection to the present application being made to the Court for confirmation. I also made an order that the applicants pay the costs of the proceedings of APRA as agreed or assessed. Finally I directed that both orders be entered forthwith.

The liquidator has been acting in the capacity of liquidator under what he expected to be a members' voluntary winding up of each of the two companies. However, there was an omission or oversight on the part of the liquidator or his staff that has the consequence that the windings up could be treated as creditors' voluntary windings up. 2 Under s 9 of the Corporations Act , a creditors' voluntary winding up is a winding up under Part 5.5 , other than a members' voluntary winding up. Under s 9 , a members' voluntary winding up is a winding up where a declaration has been made and lodged pursuant to s 494 . Section 494(1) provides that a majority of directors of a company may make a written declaration to the effect that they have made an inquiry into the affairs of the company and that they have formed the opinion that the company would be able to pay its debts in full within a period not exceeding 12 months after the commencement of the winding up of the company. Under s 494(2) , there must be attached to the declaration a statement of affairs of the company showing the property of the company, the liabilities of the company and the estimated expenses of winding up. The written declaration must be made before the date on which the notices of the meeting at which the resolution for the winding up of the company is to be proposed are sent out. 3 However, s 494(3) relevantly provides that a declaration made under s 494(1) has no effect for the purposes of the Act unless: (a) the declaration is made at the meeting of directors referred to in section 494(1) ; (b) the declaration is lodged before the date on which the notices of the meeting at which the resolution for the winding up for the company is to be proposed are sent out; and (c) the resolution for voluntary winding up is passed within the period of five weeks after the making of the declaration. 4 The current share holders of Hicom International are Warmen Investments Pty Ltd in respect of 10 million shares, and Hawkesbridge Limited in respect of one share. The present directors of Hicom International are Vivian Hugh King and Joshua Watson Rowe. The only shareholder of Hicom Sales is Hicom International. The current directors of Hicom Sales are Vivian Hugh King and Richard Franklin Williams. 5 On 19 April 2007, at a meeting of the directors of Hicom Sales, it was resolved that Messrs King and Williams sign a declaration of solvency and that a meeting of the company be convened for the purposes of considering a resolution that the company be wound up under a members' voluntary liquidation.    A declaration of solvency that was signed pursuant to that resolution discloses that Hicom Sales has no assets and no liabilities. The declaration of solvency was lodged with Australian Securities and Investment Commission (the Commission) at 3.58 pm on 23 April 2007. On the same day, Hicom International consented to an extraordinary general meeting of Hicom Sales being convened and held on that day and, on that day, notice of the meeting was given to Hicom International. A meeting was then held at which a special resolution was passed that Hicom Sales be wound up under a members' voluntary liquidation. Thus, there was a failure to satisfy s 494(3)(b) , which required that the declaration be lodged with the Commission before the date on which the notices of meeting were sent. It was, in fact, lodged on the same day. 6 That difficulty was compounded by the process undertaken in relation to Hicom International. At a meeting of the directors of Hicom International held on 23 April 2007, attended by Messrs King and Rowe, it was resolved that Messrs King and Rowe sign a declaration of solvency. On that day, Messrs King and Rowe signed a declaration of solvency showing that Hicom International had assets consisting of cash at bank of \\$22,850, and no liabilities, other than estimated expenses of winding up in the sum of \\$22,850. The declaration of solvency was lodged electronically with the Commission at 4.14 pm on 23 April 2007. 7 Also on 23 April 2007, Warmen Investments Pty Ltd and Hawkesbridge Ltd consented to a meeting of Hicom International being convened on that day. Notice was accordingly given of a meeting to be held on that day. A meeting was in fact held on 23 April 2007, at which a special resolution was passed that Hicom International be wound up under a members' voluntary liquidation. Thus there was a failure to satisfy the requirements of 494(3)(a) and (b), in that the declaration was not made before the date on which the notices of the meeting were sent and it was not lodged with the Commission before the date on which the notices of meeting went sent. 8 While there is provision in s 494(3)(b) for the Commission to extend the time for lodgement, there is no provision for the Commission to remedy a failure to comply with s 494(3) , insofar as that provision requires that the declaration be made before the date on which notices of the meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed are sent out. The liquidator now applies for orders under s 1322 of the Corporations Act to ensure that the windings up can continue as members' voluntary windings up. While there may not be serious consequences if the windings up are to be treated as creditors' voluntary windings up, one can understand that the directors may have some residual concern that the records would show that they were directors of companies that were wound up as creditors' voluntary windings up rather than members' voluntary windings up.    It does not appear to matter otherwise. 9 The liquidator caused a notice inviting formal proof of debt or claim for each of the companies to be advertised in The Daily Telegraph newspaper on 24 April 2007 and caused his appointment as liquidator to be advertised in The Commonwealth Government Gazette on 8 May 2007. The liquidator has not received any notification of the existence of any creditor of either company as at today. He has also been informed by the directors and members of each of the companies, and believes, that neither of the companies has any creditors. In the absence of creditors, there would be little point in purporting to convene a meeting of creditors, as would be required under a creditors' voluntary winding up. 10 Section 1322(2) of the Corporations Act provides that a proceeding under the Act is not invalidated because of any procedural irregularity, unless the Court is of the opinion that the irregularity has caused or may cause substantial injustice and the Court by order declares the proceeding to be invalid. It may be that the making of a declaration of solvency and proceeding with a winding up on the basis that it is a members' voluntary winding up is a proceeding within the meaning of s 1322. However, that is not entirely without doubt. On the other hand, I would certainly be satisfied that what has happened is a procedural irregularity. 11 Section 1322(4)(a) provides that the Court may make an order declaring that any act purporting to have been taken under the Corporations Act is not invalid by reason of any contravention of a provision of the Act. There is no requirement for a declaration of solvency to be made before the date on which notices of a proposed meeting of members are sent, or for a declaration of insolvency to be lodged before that date. The effect of s 494(3) is simply to provide that, unless those prerequisites are satisfied, a purported declaration of solvency has no effect for the purposes of the Act. If the prerequisites are not satisfied it would follow that there is no members' voluntary winding up, but only a creditors' voluntary winding up. 12 Whether or not contravention should be given a broader meaning, having regard to the remedial objects of s 1322(4) , under s 1322(4)(d) , the Court may make an order abridging the time for doing any act, or taking any proceeding under the Act, or in relation to a corporation. It seems to me that an order under s 1322(4) would achieve the aims of the liquidator to ensure that the windings up are to be treated as members' voluntary windings up. Under s 1322(4) , the Court may make such consequential and similar orders as it thinks fit. 13 I am satisfied, in the circumstances, that no substantial injustice has been, or is likely to be caused to any person by reason of the failure to satisfy the strict requirements of s 494(3).    Accordingly it would be appropriate to abridge the time for lodging the relevant declarations of solvency and for the passing of the resolution by the directors. It would also be appropriate to make declarations that the declarations of solvency are not invalid by reason of the failure to comply strictly with s 494(3). I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.

Capital is a wholly owned subsidiary of Green Pacific. The Liquidator has now formed the view that it would be in the interests of the creditors of both companies for a deed of company arrangement to be approved. Accordingly, he now seeks orders of the Court granting leave for him to be appointed, together with his partner Philip Patrick Carter, as administrators of Green Pacific and Capital. The Liquidator also seeks ancillary orders concerning the operation of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) requiring meetings of creditors to be convened. Unless the Court is satisfied that there would be some utility in acceding to the Liquidator's application, there would be no point in doing so. It is, therefore, necessary to say something about the proposal that the Liquidator wishes to have put to the creditors. 2 At present, the issued capital of Green Pacific is some 377 million shares. Of those shares, 8.7% are held by entities associated with Mr Alfred Wong, who was the managing director of Green Pacific until the winding up orders were made. According to a draft report by the Liquidator, Green Pacific has trade creditors totalling \\$50,107. Capital has debts totalling \\$1,490,000 under promissory notes issued by Capital in connection with the raising of funds. In addition, the two companies together have liabilities totalling \\$13,135,452 owing to various entities associated with Mr Wong (the related party creditors). The related party creditors include Richland Pty Limited (Richland), the trustee of Mr Wong's family trust, in the sum of \\$8,020,048. 3 The Liquidator wishes to propound a deed of company arrangement which involves a number of interrelated transactions. It is contemplated that a fund in the sum of \\$750,000 will be established for the purposes of the deed of company arrangement. That fund will be applied in payment of the costs of the administration and in payment of the unsecured creditors of the two companies, other than the related party creditors. That sum is to be provided as to \\$510,000 by Mr Wong. 4 It is proposed that Green Pacific will continue to operate following the deed of company arrangement as a subsidiary of BMI 2 Pty Limited. BMI 2 will subscribe \\$450,000 for shares in the capital of Green Pacific and will take a transfer of the issued shares held by Mr Wong's interests.    As a consequence of that subscription and transfer, BMI 2 will hold 83.5% of the issued capital. Other shareholders, who are unconnected with Mr Wong's interests, will hold 16.5% of the shares. Of the \\$450,000 to be subscribed by BMI 2, \\$240,000 will be transferred to the proposed deed fund. The balance of \\$210,000 will be retained as working capital of Green Pacific. 5 Green Pacific has been engaged in the development of new technology for the generation of electricity and is the owner of certain intellectual property. It also owns shares in two subsidiaries engaged in that technology. It is proposed that that intellectual property and the shares in the two subsidiaries will be transferred for a nominal sum to BMI 1 Pty Limited, a related company of BMI 2. 6 It is contemplated that all of the debts of Green Pacific and Capital will be extinguished in exchange for a payment equal to approximately 83 cents in the dollar. The related party liabilities will be extinguished entirely. However, BMI 1 will assume the liability for all of the related party liabilities. At the moment, BMI 1 has a nominal share capital and will have the assets that will be transferred by Green Pacific. The terms of the assumption of liability by BMI 1 are that there will be a moratorium of 12 months on proceeding for any of the related party liabilities. 7 At the end of 12 months, BMI 1 will have various options. If they are exercised, it will be because BMI Group is satisfied that the technology has some value. It is possible, therefore, that the related party creditors will receive payment of a substantial part, or perhaps the whole, of their debts. On the other hand, it is conceivable that they will receive nothing, depending upon whether the technology turns out to be a success. 8 Whether the deed of company arrangement is approved will be a matter for the creditors of the two companies. Insofar as there is an unequal treatment of creditors, that would be a matter for the creditors to complain about, if they are so advised, by making an application to the Court on the basis that they have been unfairly discriminated against. That of course is a matter for the creditors. 9 One concern that has been raised by the Liquidator follows from the interest of the Commission in this application. The Commission was the plaintiff in the proceeding in which the Liquidator was appointed and the companies were ordered to be wound up. The Commission has raised a concern that Richland has outside creditors and that, as a consequence of the extinguishment of the debt owing to Richland by the two companies, those creditors may be prejudiced. That of course is a matter for those creditors.    Whether they will ever become aware of the proposal for the deed of company arrangement, whereby Richland's debt will be extinguished, would be a matter for Richland. 10 It would of course be open to the Commission, if it was concerned with the administration of any company, as it was with these two companies, to intervene and, if need be, notify creditors of Richland, or require Richland to notify its creditors, of the steps that Richland is proposing to take in relation to the deed of company arrangement. Short of being aware of that possibility, it seems to me that there is not a great deal that the Court can do about it. Bearing in mind, however, that this application will involve several stages so far as the deed of company arrangement is concerned, involving the Court, it is a matter over which the Court can exercise some supervision. 11 Initially, the Liquidator seeks an order that he have leave to appoint himself and his partner as administrators under s 436B(2) of the Act. Under s 436B(1) , a liquidator of a company may appoint an administrator of the company if he thinks that the company is insolvent, or is likely to become insolvent at some future time. Under s 436B(2) , a liquidator may, with the leave of the Court, appoint himself under s 436B(1). While the directors of Green Pacific and Capital do not accept that they are insolvent, the Liquidator has deposed to his belief that both of the companies are insolvent. The book value of the assets of the companies indicates that it has surplus assets. The Liquidator's belief, however, is that the assets will not achieve on winding up anything like their book value. I am satisfied that the Liquidator has no interest in the outcome of the proceeding that would make it inappropriate for him to appoint himself and his partner as administrators. 12 The Liquidator asks for orders, under s 447A of the Act, varying the operation of the Act in relation to the proposed administration in two respects. Under s 447A(1) the Court may make such orders it thinks appropriate about how Part 5.3A is to operate in relation to a particular company. Under s 436E of the Act, the administrator of a company under administration must convene a meeting of the Company's creditors in order to determine whether to appoint a committee of creditors and, if so, who are to be the committee's members. The meeting must be held within five business days after the administration beings. 13 Having regard to the small number of creditors of the companies and having regard to the consultation that has already occurred between the Liquidator and the creditors, including the Commission, which is the biggest creditor of Green Pacific, other than the related party creditors, the Liquidator contends that there is no need to have the meeting that is contemplated by s 436E. Having regard to what the Liquidator has said concerning the consultations and his intention to continue to consult with the creditors, I see no need to insist upon that meeting being convened. 14 The Liquidator also seeks an order in relation to the second meeting of creditors.    Under s 439A(1) of the Act, the administrator of a company under administration must convene a meeting of creditors within the convening period as fixed by s 439A(5) or s 493A(6). Under s 439A(2) the meeting must be held within five business days after the end of the convening period. Assuming the orders are made today, the Liquidator intends to appoint himself and his partner as administrators today and to convene the meeting of creditors contemplated by s 439A , for the purpose of considering the deed of company arrangement, to be held on 14 June 2007. 15 The meeting contemplated by s 439A(1) must be convened at least five business days before the meeting. The convening period, by the operation of s 439A(5)(b) is 21 days beginning on the day when the administration begins. The Liquidator is concerned that the effect of s 439A(2) is that the meeting cannot be held before the end of the convening period. I am by no means persuaded that that is the effect of s 439A(2). On one view, it seems to me, it does no more than require that the meeting be held no later than five business days after the end of the convening period. The section does not say that the meeting may not be held before the end of the convening period. I am not persuaded, therefore, that the second variation is entirely necessary. However, it will avoid any possible argument. The Liquidator asks that the order under s 447A provide that the administrators may convene the meeting under s 439A during the convening period, so long as the period of notice contemplated by s 439A(3) is given. 16 As I have indicated, in connection with the deed of company arrangement, various transactions are contemplated that would fall foul of s 468 of the Act, which provides that certain transactions of a company in liquidation are void, unless the Court otherwise orders. The Liquidator also asked for orders under s 468 that the proposed allotments of shares and dispositions of assets by Green Pacific not be void. I consider that it would be preferable to await the outcome of the meeting of creditors to consider the deed of company arrangement before considering making orders under s 468. 17 Finally, the Liquidator asks for an order under s 556(1)(dd) of the Act that his costs of this application be expenses in the liquidation of the companies. Having regard to the Liquidator's view that the proposed deed of company arrangement and other transactions are in the interests of creditors as a whole, it appears to me not unreasonable that those orders should be made. 18 There are other orders contemplated in the interlocutory process. If the deed of company arrangement is approved, it is contemplated that in due course the winding up be terminated.    It is premature, however, to make an order along those lines. Accordingly, it will be necessary for the liquidator to come back to the Court in due course for such an order, if the deed of company arrangement is approved.
